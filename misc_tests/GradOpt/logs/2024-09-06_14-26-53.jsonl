Introduction\nDue to the huge demand brought by the promotion of autonomous driving and robotics, light detection and ranging \n(LiDAR) technology has attracted extensive attention in the past decade. To date, various types of on-chip beam \nscanners have been demonstrated to replace mechanical scanners [1\u20134]. Optical phased arrays on silicon-on-\ninsulator (SOI) provide an attractive method to perform non-mechanical beam steering [5\u20137]. However, it still \nsuffers from the extensive and complex active phase shifting, in order to calibrate the stochastic phase errors in the \narrayed waveguides [8]. Focal plane switching arrays based on silicon photonics platform and MEMS platform \nemerge as an alternative approach due to the advantages of compact size, low power consumption and simple \ncontrol [9,10]. Among them, beam scanners based on Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer (MZI) abandon the \nmechanical moving parts entirely. In addition, ultra high-speed and low-loss optical switches can be obtained by \nintegrating novel materials with high Pockels coefficients [11,12]. In this work, we demonstrate a hybrid solid-\nstate beam scanner based on a Si3N4 switching array and a blazed grating. The output beam is steered across the \n14.3\u00b0 \u00d7 9.9\u00b0 field of view (FOV) with beam divergence less than 0.1\u00b0. In addition, a ranging distance of 7.4 m is \nachieved by combining the proposed beam scanner and the frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) \ntechnology. \nFig. 1.

Device Fabrication and Beam Steering \nAn optical micrograph of the 32-channel Si3N4 switching array with an overall footprint of 2.2 mm \u00d7 10 mm is \nshown in Fig. 1 (a). The device is fabricated on an 8-inch wafer with a 400 nm-thick PECVD Si3N4 layer by \nAdvanced Micro Foundry. Light is coupled into the chip from a grating coupler. Next, a five-layer binary tree \nformed by cascaded Si3N4 MZI switches routes the incident beam to 32 channels. Thermo-optics phase shifters are \nused to control the on-chip light path. The edge emitters are etched facet inverse tapers with a tip width of 300 nm. \nThe pitch between two adjacent edge emitters is 65 \u00b5m. The schematic of the solid-state beam scanner is depicted in \nFig. 1 (b). Beam emitted from the chip is collimated by an aspherical lens (f = 8.0 mm, NA = 0.5). Then the output \nbeam is aligned to a lithographically patterned diffraction transmission grating (966.18 lines/mm) at the Littrow \nangle. Next, a 45\u00b0 aluminum-coated mirror fixed in the 3D printed mount is used to deflect the beam direction. To \ncharacterize the beam steering, we set a screen in front of the beam scanner at a distance of 2.1 m. An infrared \ncamera records the beam profile on the screen. As shown in Fig. 1 (c), the main beam is steered across a range of \n14.3\u00b0 in \u03b8-direction by toggling the optical switches. Though phase errors still exist in the Si3N4 photonic integrated \ncircuit, the initial phase calibration takes only a few minutes. This problem can be further solved by the real-time \nfeedback control with on-chip power monitors. The angular step between two adjacent points is 0.46\u00b0, which can be \nmuch decreased by enlarging the array size in our future work. A beam steering range of 9.9\u00b0 in the \uf06a-direction is \nachieved by tuning the wavelength from 1500 nm to 1610 nm, as shown in Fig. 1 (d). The steering efficiency thus is \naround 0.09\u00b0/ nm, which is higher than the on-chip Si3N4 grating antenna in [13]. The demand of wideband tunable \nlaser with narrow linewidth still hinders further cost reduction. However, it can be solved by using the massive \ncoherent laser based on the microcomb in [14]. Finally, two-dimensional beam steering is achieved by wavelength \ntuning and switching of channels, as shown in Fig 1. (e). The beam divergency in both directions is measured to be \n< 0.1\u00b0. \n \n3.  FMCW Ranging Operation \nThe setup for FMCW ranging operation is shown in Fig. 2 (a). The FMCW RF signal is provided by the frequency \nsynthesizer based on a fractional-N phased-locked loop (PLL). It generates sawtooth chirps with a period of 1 ms. \nThe chirp range is approximately from 6 GHz to 9 GHz, as shown in Fig. 2 (b). Then the chirped laser light is \nM3F.1\nOFC 2023 \u00a9 Optica Publishing Group 2023\ngenerated by using an optical single sideband modulator. A 3dB optical power splitter distributes the output of the \nmodulator into two components: one goes straight to the balance detector as the local reference light, and the \nremaining is amplified by an Erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) as the input of the Si3N4 chip. The backscattered \nlight from the target is collected by a fiber collimator and routed to the balanced detector. An oscillograph records \nthe output of the balanced photodetector and performs real-time FFT analysis. Representative beat signals in the \ntime domain and the frequency domain of a target at 7.4m away are depicted in Fig. 2 (c) and Fig. 2 (d), respectively. \nFigure 2 (e) shows the measured beat frequency when the target distance varies from 0.7 m to 7.4 m. A strong linear \ncorrelation between the beat frequency and the target distance is observed. The slope of the linear fit is around 20.54 \nkHz/m, which is in line with the chirp slope of \u223c 3 MHz/\u00b5s. It is worth noting that the intercept at the frequency \naxis comes from the fixed fiber length difference. The chirp slope can be further increased by using FMCW PLL ICs \n[15], in order to speed up the ranging operation. \n \n4.  Conclusion \nIn conclusion, we demonstrate a hybrid solid-state beam scanner based on the Si3N4 switching array. The \ncombination of the edge emitter and the external transmission grating improves the beam quality as well as the \noptical emission efficiency. Besides, no prism lens with special designs and mechanical moving components exist in \nthe easily implemented beam scanner. Two-dimensional beam steering with a FOV of 14.3\u00b0 \u00d7 9.9\u00b0 is achieved by \nswitch toggling and wavelength tuning. Furthermore, FMCW ranging operation up to 7.4 m is also presented by \nusing the Si3N4 switching array as the transmitter. Our measurements indicate that the proposed hybrid solid-state \nbeam scanner is a scalable and flexible solution for the next-generation FMCW LiDAR. \n \n5.  References \n \n[1] D. N. Hutchison, J.
