Reason step by step\nResponse: To determine how long it will take to dry 30 shirts under the sun, we need to consider the relationship between the number of shirts and the drying time. Here are the steps to reason through the problem:\n\n1. **Understand the given information:**\n   - It takes 1 hour to dry 25 shirts under the sun.\n\n2. **Determine the drying rate:**\n   - The drying rate is 25 shirts per hour.\n\n3. **Calculate the drying time for 1 shirt:**\n   - If 25 shirts take 1 hour, then 1 shirt would take \\(\\frac{1 \\text{ hour}}{25 \\text{ shirts}} = \\frac{1}{25} \\text{ hours per shirt}\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the drying time for 30 shirts:**\n   - If 1 shirt takes \\(\\frac{1}{25}\\) hours, then 30 shirts would take \\(30 \\times \\frac{1}{25} \\text{ hours}\\).\n\n5. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   - \\(30 \\times \\frac{1}{25} = \\frac{30}{25} = 1.2 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\nSo, it will take 1.2 hours to dry 30 shirts under the sun.",
