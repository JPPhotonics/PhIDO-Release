For instance, you could ask the model to identify and correct any spelling errors, grammar mistakes, or punctuation issues in the given sentence. This would guide the model to focus on particular aspects of correctness, leading to a more targeted evaluation. Additionally, you could prompt the model to explain why a sentence is correct or incorrect, which would require a deeper understanding of language rules and conventions. By adding more complexity and specificity to the prompt, you can challenge the model to provide more detailed and insightful evaluations, ultimately improving the overall quality of feedback.",
