The dimensional expansion\nis achieved by WDM devices, which play a crucial role in\nrealizing matrix\u2013matrix multiplication together with the\nbroadband characteristics of an MZI. We implemented a\n2 \u00d7 2 arbitrary nonnegative valued matrix using a reconfig-\nurable 8 \u00d7 8 MZI array structure.

This provides a new effective solution\nfor large-scale integrated optical computing systems based\non convolution acceleration processors.\n\u00a9 2023 Optica Pub-\nlishing Group\nhttps://doi.org/10.1364/OL.488464\nThe requirement for computing power is rising in tandem with\nthe expansion of artificial intelligence applications [1,2]. Elec-\ntronic devices are unable to meet the aforementioned standards\nbecause they are limited by the speed of traditional microelec-\ntronic processors. The photon has become a new topic of study as\nan information carrier [3\u20135]. Matrix multiplications and addition\ncalculations are performed by photonic acceleration processors\nutilizing photonic devices [6,7], which can further be combined\nwith electrical devices to build photonic neural networks (PNNs)\nfor artificial intelligence applications. As a result, it is anticipated\nthat a photonic acceleration processor will operate quicker and\nmore efficiently than its electrical counterpart.\nIn the majority of the recent research on photonic acceleration\nprocessors, photonic devices have been used to realize vector-\nmatrix multiplication (VMM). These processors are primarily\nimplemented by Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer (MZI) arrays\n[8\u201312] and parallel computing systems based on wavelength\ndivision multiplexer (WDM) technology [13\u201318]. However,\nMZI arrays are currently implemented mainly by coherent light,\nwhich has the defects of high impact of phase error accumula-\ntion, low scalability, and high impact by off-chip optical phase.\nCurrently, optical systems implemented based on WDM technol-\nogy mainly use micro-ring weight banks or crossbar structures\nof phase change materials to implement weight matrices. How-\never, the micro-ring array has phase sensitivity problems, which\ngreatly increases the difficulty of realization. The computational\nunit of phase change materials is not easily compatible with the\ntraditional complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)\nprocess. These systems can only realize the multiplication and\naddition of one vector and matrix at each operation, which has\nthe problem of insufficient arithmetic power. In the current mod-\nels, the major way to increase the arithmetic power is to increase\nthe scale of the computational chip, which has large hardware\nerrors such as additional packaging and electrical power con-\nsumption problems. Therefore, it is challenging to realize a\nhigher computational power integrated optical computing chip\n[14].\nAlthough the above-mentioned systems emphasize VMM\nacceleration, it is crucial to note that general matrix\u2013matrix mul-\ntiplication frequently predominates in deep learning computing\n[19,20]. Multiple input vectors must be combined into a single\nmatrix and multiplied simultaneously with a weight matrix to\nachieve optical matrix\u2013matrix multiplication. Therefore, VMM\nacceleration processors must operate sequentially or in parallel\n[19], which necessitates numerous computational cycles or mul-\ntiple parallel devices, but it has a large disadvantage in terms\nof computational efficiency or computational energy efficiency\nratio.\nObviously, the major way to improve the computational power\nand energy efficiency ratio of optical computing is by imple-\nmenting parallel computation of matrix\u2013matrix multiplication\nin a compact system.\nIn this paper, we propose a matrix\u2013matrix multiplication\nacceleration processor based on a WDM system and a non-\ncoherent MZI array. WDM devices are used to achieve the\ndimensional expansion of the input and output, which then\nenable matrix\u2013matrix multiplication to improve the paral-\nlel computational capability of the system. The non-coherent\nMZI array is implemented using dilated double-layer networks\n(DDLNs) [21], which can realize arbitrary nonnegative valued\nmatrices with low optical path loss and phase error accumu-\nlation. We implemented a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix multiplier of\n0146-9592/23/123231-04 Journal \u00a9 2023 Optica Publishing Group\n3232\nVol. 48, No. 12 / 15 June 2023 / Optics Letters\nLetter\nFig. 1.\nSchematic of photonic acceleration processor: (a) a\nphotonic neural network; (b) a photonic acceleration processor.\nnonnegative values using an 8 \u00d7 8 programmable MZI array as\nwell as four WDM devices. We experimentally verified that this\nstructure could achieve 90.5% inference accuracy in the clas-\nsification task of the Modified National Institute of Standards\nand Technology (MNIST) handwritten dataset in the PNN. This\nprovides an effective network for a large-scale integrated optical\ncomputing system based on matrix\u2013matrix convolution.\nFigure 1(a) is a schematic diagram of the photonic neural\nnetwork, which consists of an input layer, hidden layers, and\nan output layer. Optical signals are encoded by light intensity\nthrough a data arrangement unit in the WDM-based non-\ncoherent architecture. The proposed 2 \u00d7 2 topology network of\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication is shown in Fig. 1(b), which is\ncomposed of four MZIs and four WDMs. The input data [x1, x2,\nx3, x4, . . . , xn] with the different wavelengths [\u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3, \u03bb4, . . . ,\n\u03bbn] are simultaneously fed into the photonic hidden layer for the\nconvolution of matrices. The output result based on different\nwavelengths is represented as yi. The basic unit of the network\nis an MZI with an adjustable beam splitting ratio ai, bi, ci, di, i\n\u2208(0, 1, 2, . . . , N) in the interval from 0 to 1. Each MZI consists\nof two multimode interferometers (MMIs) with transmissivity\nfixed at 50:50 and two phase shifters, where one of the phase-\nshift arms uses thermal tuning to change the phase and thus the\nbeam-splitting ratio of the MZI unit. Since the MZI topology is\nsimilar to the DDLN, it perfectly inherits the advantage of low\noptical path loss in that structure [21]. Moreover, the number\nof MZI cascades in the middle of this structure is only two in\nany dimension, which further reduces the influence of phase\nerror accumulation on the calculation results in combination\nwith non-coherent light. A mapping function is formed between\nthe input and output:\n[\ufe03\ny11\ny12\ny21\ny22\n]\ufe03\n=\n[\ufe03\na1b1\nc1(1 \u2212b1)\n(1 \u2212a1)d1\n(1 \u2212c1)(1 \u2212d1)\n]\ufe03\n\u00d7\n[\ufe03\nx11\nx12\nx21\nx22\n]\ufe03\n.\n(1)\nThe input data x11 and x21 represent the input signal of wave-\nlength \u03bb1, and x12 and x22 represent the input signal of wavelength\n\u03bb2. The output data y11 and y21 are the y1 and y2 channel output\npower of wavelength \u03bb1, and y12 and y22 are the y1 and y2 chan-\nnel output power of wavelength \u03bb2, respectively. The parameters\na1, b1, c1, and d1 represent the beam-splitting ratio of the four\nadjustable MZIs in the network. The external voltage is loaded\nto the adjustable phase shift arm to alter phase when the optical\nsignal is input from the upper port of the MZI. The MZI unit\nis in the cross-state when the \u03c0 phase shift is reached, and we\ndefine the splitting ratio as 0. The MZI is in a bar-state and the\nsplitting ratio is defined as 1 when the phase difference between\nthe two phase shifters is 0. At this point, the upper port of the\nMZI output can deliver the maximum output. The MZI array\nusing this method can produce an arbitrary nonnegative valued\nmatrix. Although the splitting ratios of the MZI units within the\nstructure require matrix-based computation, it is adaptable for\nreal-time updates in on-chip training applications. Furthermore,\ncompared with traditional Mesh arrays [8], the proposed method\nreduces the computational load associated with singular value\ndecomposition calculations.\nWe used a programmable 8 \u00d7 8 thermo-optical, Benes-\nnetwork-based MZI array [22] and four WDMs to validate\nthe topology of the proposed 2 \u00d7 2 topology network of\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication. On the one hand, the channel\ncenter wavelengths of our selected commercial WDM devices\n(Flyin) are 1310 nm and 1330 nm, respectively. It has a 0.5-dB\nbandwidth of 13 nm. We chose the two wavelengths close car-\nrier wavelengths of 1316.5 nm and 1323.5 nm, which reduced\nthe requirement for wide bandwidth in the MZI wavelength char-\nacteristics. On the other hand, the schematic illustration of the\nstructure of a 2 \u00d7 2 nonnegative valued matrix using an 8 \u00d7 8\nBenes network is shown in Fig. 2(a). The input data were simul-\ntaneously encoded at two wavelengths and fed into the MZI\narray. It transmitted the data to the tunable MZI units through\nthe red dotted line-based path of the MZI. We adjusted the a1, b1,\nc1, and d1 to operate under an arbitrary matrix and thus receive\ninformation at the output for both wavelengths. The MZI array\nwas fabricated on top of a silicon-on-insulator wafer using the\nCMOS process at the Singapore Advanced Micro Foundry. It\nhas a 220-nm top silicon layer and a 3-\u00b5m buried oxide layer.\nThe ridge waveguide has a width of 500 nm and a height of\n130 nm, with a phase-shifter arm width of 2 \u00b5m and a length\nof 100 \u00b5m. The thermo-optic resistor has a width of 2 \u00b5m and a\nP\u03c0 of 19 mW. Figure 2(b) shows the microscopy image of the\nfabricated 8 \u00d7 8 MZI arrays for the proposed 2 \u00d7 2 nonnegative\nvalued matrix. The inset in Fig. 2(b) depicts a magnified image of\nthe MZI unit. Both phase shift arms are tunable, however, only\na single tunable phase shifter was loaded with voltage in the\nexperiment. We have pre-tested all the MZI states by a grating-\npower monitor in the array. Additionally, the signal should be\nFig. 2.\nSchematic of the fabricated device.

The inset is an enlarged illustration of the\nMZI unit.\nLetter\nVol. 48, No. 12 / 15 June 2023 / Optics Letters\n3233\nFig. 3.\nWavelength dependence transmission spectrum of the\nMZI unit with different bias voltages. The enlarged inset shows\nthe transmission spectrum between wavelengths 1316.5 nm and\n1323.5 nm.\ncalculated through a logical path to prevent it from being trans-\nmitted to the monitoring points, which can reduce power loss\nand calculation error.\nFigure 3 shows the transmission spectra of the cross port of\nthe MZI unit of the 8 \u00d7 8 MZI array at the wavelength range of\n1280 nm to 1360 nm, for bias voltages of 0 V, 1 V, 1.6 V, 2 V,\n2.5 V, and 3 V. The insertion loss of the MZI unit at 1310 nm\nis approximately \u22123.2 dB. As the voltage increases, the port\u2019s\noutput power decreases, and the trend is consistent with the ini-\ntial state. The enlarged image in Fig. 3 shows the difference of\n0.49 dB in the transmission power of the MZI unit at 1316.5 nm\nand 1323.5 nm. We can compensate for the error using the input\npower. Therefore, in the range of this wavelength, we can default\nthe response of the tunable MZI unit to be the same for different\nwavelengths of signals loaded with different bias voltages. It\ncan be inferred that the light intensity after the transmission is\nthe same for the whole MZI array for different wavelengths of\noptical signals, ensuring that signals of various wavelengths can\nbe multiplied by the same matrix. The fluctuations in the trans-\nmission spectrum may be attributed to reflections and scattering\noccurring at the interfaces of waveguide structures or grating\ncouplers, as well as to environmental factors.\nThe experimental setup for the system validation is shown\nin Fig. 4. We demonstrated the computation of multiplication\nand addition of 2 \u00d7 2 matrices based on the MNIST handwrit-\nten digits dataset. The result of this computation is the first\nconvolutional layer in the PNN model for the task of handwrit-\nten digit recognition and classification. For each image in the\ndataset, there were 28 \u00d7 28 gray scale pixel values to be calcu-\nlated. These values were normalized and encoded as coefficients\nof one-dimensional radio frequency (RF) signals in a specific\norder. The RF signals output from an arbitrary waveform gen-\nerator (AWG, Keysight M8194A) were amplified by microwave\namplifiers (SHF 804B) and were loaded onto commercial mod-\nulators (iXblue MX1300-LN-40). By using DC voltage, the\nmodulators were set to operate at a 3-dB operating point. A\nmaximum calculation rate of 40 GMAC/s was possible thanks\nto the AWG\u2019s sampling rate of 100 GSa/s and the input data\u2019s\nsampling rate of 20 samples per symbol (sps).

The optical signal containing the input-data informa-\ntion was obtained from the modulator and fed to two independent\nWDMs. The output optical signals of the WDMs were verti-\ncally coupled to the chip using a fiber array. The on-chip loss at\n1310 nm is approximately \u221216.2 dB. Finally, the optical signals\ncarrying the calculation results were demultiplexed by WDMs,\nand the optical signals of different wavelengths were fed into\na praseodymium-doped fiber amplifier (AMP-FL8611-OB-20)\nfor amplification. A balanced photoelectric detector (Finisar\nBPDV2120R) then turned these into electrical signals, which\nwere then detected by a real-time oscilloscope (UXR0594A,\n256 GSa/s, 59 GHz bandwidth). Using a computer, the collected\nwaveforms were time-synchronized, down-sampled to 1 sps, and\nthen transferred to the PNN\u2019s next layer.\nFigure 5(a) illustrates the architecture of the PNN of our chip\nfor image recognition tasks. It consists of an input layer, two\nconvolution layers, two fully connected layers, and an output\nlayer. The optical matrix multiplication and addition opera-\ntions are the first convolution layer. The 28 \u00d7 28 gray scale\nimages were encoded as 784 \u00d7 20 vectors and fed into the opti-\ncal matrix\u2013matrix multiplier in four groups sequentially. The\ncalculation\u2019s output was transferred to the hidden layer below\nafter being down-sampled to a value of 784 \u00d7 1. The output\nlayer divided the data into 10 groups that correspond to the\nintegers 0 to 9. The simulation model was built in PyTorch\n[23] and trained by a stochastic gradient descent optimizer with\na learning rate of 0.005. The activation function used in the\nPNN model was rectified linear unit [24]. The real-time com-\nputational results of the y11 port are shown in Fig. 5(b) when\nthe computational data of the x11 channel are supplied. The red\nsolid curve is the result obtained from the simulation and the\nblue dashed curve is the experimentally obtained time trajectory.\nWithin 20 ns continually, the computed data essentially match\nthe simulated data, indicating great computation accuracy for a\ncomputing rate of 40 GMAC/s. A 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix convolu-\ntion calculation implemented in an optical system was used to\nbuild a PNN to classify handwritten digits in the dataset MNIST.\nThe dataset was divided into a training set and a test set. Our\nmodel had been trained on the whole training set, and 200 sam-\nples from the test set were used to check the precision of the\nresults computed on the chip.

The accuracy is not only influenced by errors\nin input encoding, output data extraction, and device insertion\nloss during testing, but also closely related to factors such as\nthe PNN network structure and training parameters. In future\nresearch, accuracy can be further improved by optimizing these\naspects.\nIn conclusion, we have presented a novel, to the best of\nour knowledge, 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix multiplication acceleration\nprocessor that uses a WDM system and a non-coherent MZI\narray. The WDM devices enable the extension of the input and\noutput dimensions, and the wide bandwidth of MZI devices\nallows different wavelengths to function properly within the\noptical computing chip. This enables matrix\u2013matrix multiplica-\ntion and addition operations, thereby enhancing the parallelism\nand computational power of optical computing. In our sys-\ntem, a nonnegative weight matrix is cleverly implemented\nusing a dilated double-layer-based MZI array, inheriting the\nadvantages of this structure in terms of optical path loss.\nWe have experimentally demonstrated the feasibility of this\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication acceleration processor by using\nit to perform image recognition on handwritten digits from\nthe MNIST dataset and have achieved an inference accuracy\nof 90.5% with a computing rate of 40 GMAC/s. Consid-\nering the encoding of digital-to-analog converters and the\nsampling of analog-to-digital converters, their time overhead\ndoes not increase with the matrix scale N. Nevertheless, the\ncomputational capacity of the proposed structure grows propor-\ntionally to N2, thereby emphasizing its advantages in large-scale\narrays.

The dimensional expansion\nis achieved by WDM devices, which play a crucial role in\nrealizing matrix\u2013matrix multiplication together with the\nbroadband characteristics of an MZI. We implemented a\n2 \u00d7 2 arbitrary nonnegative valued matrix using a reconfig-\nurable 8 \u00d7 8 MZI array structure. Through experimentation,\nwe verified that this structure could achieve 90.5% infer-\nence accuracy in a classification task for the Modified\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST)\nhandwritten dataset. This provides a new effective solution\nfor large-scale integrated optical computing systems based\non convolution acceleration processors.\n\u00a9 2023 Optica Pub-\nlishing Group\nhttps://doi.org/10.1364/OL.488464\nThe requirement for computing power is rising in tandem with\nthe expansion of artificial intelligence applications [1,2]. Elec-\ntronic devices are unable to meet the aforementioned standards\nbecause they are limited by the speed of traditional microelec-\ntronic processors. The photon has become a new topic of study as\nan information carrier [3\u20135]. Matrix multiplications and addition\ncalculations are performed by photonic acceleration processors\nutilizing photonic devices [6,7], which can further be combined\nwith electrical devices to build photonic neural networks (PNNs)\nfor artificial intelligence applications. As a result, it is anticipated\nthat a photonic acceleration processor will operate quicker and\nmore efficiently than its electrical counterpart.\nIn the majority of the recent research on photonic acceleration\nprocessors, photonic devices have been used to realize vector-\nmatrix multiplication (VMM). These processors are primarily\nimplemented by Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer (MZI) arrays\n[8\u201312] and parallel computing systems based on wavelength\ndivision multiplexer (WDM) technology [13\u201318]. However,\nMZI arrays are currently implemented mainly by coherent light,\nwhich has the defects of high impact of phase error accumula-\ntion, low scalability, and high impact by off-chip optical phase.\nCurrently, optical systems implemented based on WDM technol-\nogy mainly use micro-ring weight banks or crossbar structures\nof phase change materials to implement weight matrices. How-\never, the micro-ring array has phase sensitivity problems, which\ngreatly increases the difficulty of realization. The computational\nunit of phase change materials is not easily compatible with the\ntraditional complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)\nprocess. These systems can only realize the multiplication and\naddition of one vector and matrix at each operation, which has\nthe problem of insufficient arithmetic power. In the current mod-\nels, the major way to increase the arithmetic power is to increase\nthe scale of the computational chip, which has large hardware\nerrors such as additional packaging and electrical power con-\nsumption problems. Therefore, it is challenging to realize a\nhigher computational power integrated optical computing chip\n[14].\nAlthough the above-mentioned systems emphasize VMM\nacceleration, it is crucial to note that general matrix\u2013matrix mul-\ntiplication frequently predominates in deep learning computing\n[19,20]. Multiple input vectors must be combined into a single\nmatrix and multiplied simultaneously with a weight matrix to\nachieve optical matrix\u2013matrix multiplication. Therefore, VMM\nacceleration processors must operate sequentially or in parallel\n[19], which necessitates numerous computational cycles or mul-\ntiple parallel devices, but it has a large disadvantage in terms\nof computational efficiency or computational energy efficiency\nratio.\nObviously, the major way to improve the computational power\nand energy efficiency ratio of optical computing is by imple-\nmenting parallel computation of matrix\u2013matrix multiplication\nin a compact system.\nIn this paper, we propose a matrix\u2013matrix multiplication\nacceleration processor based on a WDM system and a non-\ncoherent MZI array. WDM devices are used to achieve the\ndimensional expansion of the input and output, which then\nenable matrix\u2013matrix multiplication to improve the paral-\nlel computational capability of the system. The non-coherent\nMZI array is implemented using dilated double-layer networks\n(DDLNs) [21], which can realize arbitrary nonnegative valued\nmatrices with low optical path loss and phase error accumu-\nlation. We implemented a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix multiplier of\n0146-9592/23/123231-04 Journal \u00a9 2023 Optica Publishing Group\n3232\nVol. 48, No. 12 / 15 June 2023 / Optics Letters\nLetter\nFig. 1.\nSchematic of photonic acceleration processor: (a) a\nphotonic neural network; (b) a photonic acceleration processor.\nnonnegative values using an 8 \u00d7 8 programmable MZI array as\nwell as four WDM devices. We experimentally verified that this\nstructure could achieve 90.5% inference accuracy in the clas-\nsification task of the Modified National Institute of Standards\nand Technology (MNIST) handwritten dataset in the PNN. This\nprovides an effective network for a large-scale integrated optical\ncomputing system based on matrix\u2013matrix convolution.\nFigure 1(a) is a schematic diagram of the photonic neural\nnetwork, which consists of an input layer, hidden layers, and\nan output layer. Optical signals are encoded by light intensity\nthrough a data arrangement unit in the WDM-based non-\ncoherent architecture. The proposed 2 \u00d7 2 topology network of\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication is shown in Fig. 1(b), which is\ncomposed of four MZIs and four WDMs. The input data [x1, x2,\nx3, x4, . . . , xn] with the different wavelengths [\u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3, \u03bb4, . . . ,\n\u03bbn] are simultaneously fed into the photonic hidden layer for the\nconvolution of matrices. The output result based on different\nwavelengths is represented as yi. The basic unit of the network\nis an MZI with an adjustable beam splitting ratio ai, bi, ci, di, i\n\u2208(0, 1, 2, . . . , N) in the interval from 0 to 1. Each MZI consists\nof two multimode interferometers (MMIs) with transmissivity\nfixed at 50:50 and two phase shifters, where one of the phase-\nshift arms uses thermal tuning to change the phase and thus the\nbeam-splitting ratio of the MZI unit. Since the MZI topology is\nsimilar to the DDLN, it perfectly inherits the advantage of low\noptical path loss in that structure [21]. Moreover, the number\nof MZI cascades in the middle of this structure is only two in\nany dimension, which further reduces the influence of phase\nerror accumulation on the calculation results in combination\nwith non-coherent light. A mapping function is formed between\nthe input and output:\n[\ufe03\ny11\ny12\ny21\ny22\n]\ufe03\n=\n[\ufe03\na1b1\nc1(1 \u2212b1)\n(1 \u2212a1)d1\n(1 \u2212c1)(1 \u2212d1)\n]\ufe03\n\u00d7\n[\ufe03\nx11\nx12\nx21\nx22\n]\ufe03\n.\n(1)\nThe input data x11 and x21 represent the input signal of wave-\nlength \u03bb1, and x12 and x22 represent the input signal of wavelength\n\u03bb2. The output data y11 and y21 are the y1 and y2 channel output\npower of wavelength \u03bb1, and y12 and y22 are the y1 and y2 chan-\nnel output power of wavelength \u03bb2, respectively. The parameters\na1, b1, c1, and d1 represent the beam-splitting ratio of the four\nadjustable MZIs in the network. The external voltage is loaded\nto the adjustable phase shift arm to alter phase when the optical\nsignal is input from the upper port of the MZI. The MZI unit\nis in the cross-state when the \u03c0 phase shift is reached, and we\ndefine the splitting ratio as 0. The MZI is in a bar-state and the\nsplitting ratio is defined as 1 when the phase difference between\nthe two phase shifters is 0. At this point, the upper port of the\nMZI output can deliver the maximum output. The MZI array\nusing this method can produce an arbitrary nonnegative valued\nmatrix. Although the splitting ratios of the MZI units within the\nstructure require matrix-based computation, it is adaptable for\nreal-time updates in on-chip training applications. Furthermore,\ncompared with traditional Mesh arrays [8], the proposed method\nreduces the computational load associated with singular value\ndecomposition calculations.\nWe used a programmable 8 \u00d7 8 thermo-optical, Benes-\nnetwork-based MZI array [22] and four WDMs to validate\nthe topology of the proposed 2 \u00d7 2 topology network of\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication. On the one hand, the channel\ncenter wavelengths of our selected commercial WDM devices\n(Flyin) are 1310 nm and 1330 nm, respectively. It has a 0.5-dB\nbandwidth of 13 nm. We chose the two wavelengths close car-\nrier wavelengths of 1316.5 nm and 1323.5 nm, which reduced\nthe requirement for wide bandwidth in the MZI wavelength char-\nacteristics. On the other hand, the schematic illustration of the\nstructure of a 2 \u00d7 2 nonnegative valued matrix using an 8 \u00d7 8\nBenes network is shown in Fig. 2(a). The input data were simul-\ntaneously encoded at two wavelengths and fed into the MZI\narray. It transmitted the data to the tunable MZI units through\nthe red dotted line-based path of the MZI. We adjusted the a1, b1,\nc1, and d1 to operate under an arbitrary matrix and thus receive\ninformation at the output for both wavelengths. The MZI array\nwas fabricated on top of a silicon-on-insulator wafer using the\nCMOS process at the Singapore Advanced Micro Foundry. It\nhas a 220-nm top silicon layer and a 3-\u00b5m buried oxide layer.\nThe ridge waveguide has a width of 500 nm and a height of\n130 nm, with a phase-shifter arm width of 2 \u00b5m and a length\nof 100 \u00b5m.

The enlarged inset shows\nthe transmission spectrum between wavelengths 1316.5 nm and\n1323.5 nm.\ncalculated through a logical path to prevent it from being trans-\nmitted to the monitoring points, which can reduce power loss\nand calculation error.\nFigure 3 shows the transmission spectra of the cross port of\nthe MZI unit of the 8 \u00d7 8 MZI array at the wavelength range of\n1280 nm to 1360 nm, for bias voltages of 0 V, 1 V, 1.6 V, 2 V,\n2.5 V, and 3 V. The insertion loss of the MZI unit at 1310 nm\nis approximately \u22123.2 dB. As the voltage increases, the port\u2019s\noutput power decreases, and the trend is consistent with the ini-\ntial state. The enlarged image in Fig. 3 shows the difference of\n0.49 dB in the transmission power of the MZI unit at 1316.5 nm\nand 1323.5 nm. We can compensate for the error using the input\npower. Therefore, in the range of this wavelength, we can default\nthe response of the tunable MZI unit to be the same for different\nwavelengths of signals loaded with different bias voltages. It\ncan be inferred that the light intensity after the transmission is\nthe same for the whole MZI array for different wavelengths of\noptical signals, ensuring that signals of various wavelengths can\nbe multiplied by the same matrix. The fluctuations in the trans-\nmission spectrum may be attributed to reflections and scattering\noccurring at the interfaces of waveguide structures or grating\ncouplers, as well as to environmental factors.\nThe experimental setup for the system validation is shown\nin Fig. 4. We demonstrated the computation of multiplication\nand addition of 2 \u00d7 2 matrices based on the MNIST handwrit-\nten digits dataset. The result of this computation is the first\nconvolutional layer in the PNN model for the task of handwrit-\nten digit recognition and classification. For each image in the\ndataset, there were 28 \u00d7 28 gray scale pixel values to be calcu-\nlated. These values were normalized and encoded as coefficients\nof one-dimensional radio frequency (RF) signals in a specific\norder. The RF signals output from an arbitrary waveform gen-\nerator (AWG, Keysight M8194A) were amplified by microwave\namplifiers (SHF 804B) and were loaded onto commercial mod-\nulators (iXblue MX1300-LN-40). By using DC voltage, the\nmodulators were set to operate at a 3-dB operating point. A\nmaximum calculation rate of 40 GMAC/s was possible thanks\nto the AWG\u2019s sampling rate of 100 GSa/s and the input data\u2019s\nsampling rate of 20 samples per symbol (sps).

The optical signal containing the input-data informa-\ntion was obtained from the modulator and fed to two independent\nWDMs. The output optical signals of the WDMs were verti-\ncally coupled to the chip using a fiber array. The on-chip loss at\n1310 nm is approximately \u221216.2 dB. Finally, the optical signals\ncarrying the calculation results were demultiplexed by WDMs,\nand the optical signals of different wavelengths were fed into\na praseodymium-doped fiber amplifier (AMP-FL8611-OB-20)\nfor amplification. A balanced photoelectric detector (Finisar\nBPDV2120R) then turned these into electrical signals, which\nwere then detected by a real-time oscilloscope (UXR0594A,\n256 GSa/s, 59 GHz bandwidth). Using a computer, the collected\nwaveforms were time-synchronized, down-sampled to 1 sps, and\nthen transferred to the PNN\u2019s next layer.\nFigure 5(a) illustrates the architecture of the PNN of our chip\nfor image recognition tasks. It consists of an input layer, two\nconvolution layers, two fully connected layers, and an output\nlayer. The optical matrix multiplication and addition opera-\ntions are the first convolution layer. The 28 \u00d7 28 gray scale\nimages were encoded as 784 \u00d7 20 vectors and fed into the opti-\ncal matrix\u2013matrix multiplier in four groups sequentially. The\ncalculation\u2019s output was transferred to the hidden layer below\nafter being down-sampled to a value of 784 \u00d7 1. The output\nlayer divided the data into 10 groups that correspond to the\nintegers 0 to 9. The simulation model was built in PyTorch\n[23] and trained by a stochastic gradient descent optimizer with\na learning rate of 0.005. The activation function used in the\nPNN model was rectified linear unit [24]. The real-time com-\nputational results of the y11 port are shown in Fig. 5(b) when\nthe computational data of the x11 channel are supplied.

The accuracy is not only influenced by errors\nin input encoding, output data extraction, and device insertion\nloss during testing, but also closely related to factors such as\nthe PNN network structure and training parameters. In future\nresearch, accuracy can be further improved by optimizing these\naspects.\nIn conclusion, we have presented a novel, to the best of\nour knowledge, 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix multiplication acceleration\nprocessor that uses a WDM system and a non-coherent MZI\narray. The WDM devices enable the extension of the input and\noutput dimensions, and the wide bandwidth of MZI devices\nallows different wavelengths to function properly within the\noptical computing chip. This enables matrix\u2013matrix multiplica-\ntion and addition operations, thereby enhancing the parallelism\nand computational power of optical computing. In our sys-\ntem, a nonnegative weight matrix is cleverly implemented\nusing a dilated double-layer-based MZI array, inheriting the\nadvantages of this structure in terms of optical path loss.\nWe have experimentally demonstrated the feasibility of this\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication acceleration processor by using\nit to perform image recognition on handwritten digits from\nthe MNIST dataset and have achieved an inference accuracy\nof 90.5% with a computing rate of 40 GMAC/s. Consid-\nering the encoding of digital-to-analog converters and the\nsampling of analog-to-digital converters, their time overhead\ndoes not increase with the matrix scale N. Nevertheless, the\ncomputational capacity of the proposed structure grows propor-\ntionally to N2, thereby emphasizing its advantages in large-scale\narrays. This represents a promising solution for large-scale\nintegrated optical computing systems based on matrix\u2013matrix\nconvolution.\nFunding.\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China\n(Grant No. 2021YFA1401200); National Natural Science Foundation\nof China (62035001); Chongqing Science and Technology Foundation\n(cstc2020jscx-cy1hX0006).\nDisclosures.\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\nData availability.\nThe data concerning the results presented in this paper\nare not available publicly at this time, but the same could be made available\nfrom the authors upon reasonable request.\nREFERENCES\n1.

This provides a new effective solution\nfor large-scale integrated optical computing systems based\non convolution acceleration processors.\n\u00a9 2023 Optica Pub-\nlishing Group\nhttps://doi.org/10.1364/OL.488464\nThe requirement for computing power is rising in tandem with\nthe expansion of artificial intelligence applications [1,2]. Elec-\ntronic devices are unable to meet the aforementioned standards\nbecause they are limited by the speed of traditional microelec-\ntronic processors. The photon has become a new topic of study as\nan information carrier [3\u20135]. Matrix multiplications and addition\ncalculations are performed by photonic acceleration processors\nutilizing photonic devices [6,7], which can further be combined\nwith electrical devices to build photonic neural networks (PNNs)\nfor artificial intelligence applications. As a result, it is anticipated\nthat a photonic acceleration processor will operate quicker and\nmore efficiently than its electrical counterpart.\nIn the majority of the recent research on photonic acceleration\nprocessors, photonic devices have been used to realize vector-\nmatrix multiplication (VMM). These processors are primarily\nimplemented by Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer (MZI) arrays\n[8\u201312] and parallel computing systems based on wavelength\ndivision multiplexer (WDM) technology [13\u201318]. However,\nMZI arrays are currently implemented mainly by coherent light,\nwhich has the defects of high impact of phase error accumula-\ntion, low scalability, and high impact by off-chip optical phase.\nCurrently, optical systems implemented based on WDM technol-\nogy mainly use micro-ring weight banks or crossbar structures\nof phase change materials to implement weight matrices. How-\never, the micro-ring array has phase sensitivity problems, which\ngreatly increases the difficulty of realization. The computational\nunit of phase change materials is not easily compatible with the\ntraditional complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)\nprocess. These systems can only realize the multiplication and\naddition of one vector and matrix at each operation, which has\nthe problem of insufficient arithmetic power. In the current mod-\nels, the major way to increase the arithmetic power is to increase\nthe scale of the computational chip, which has large hardware\nerrors such as additional packaging and electrical power con-\nsumption problems. Therefore, it is challenging to realize a\nhigher computational power integrated optical computing chip\n[14].\nAlthough the above-mentioned systems emphasize VMM\nacceleration, it is crucial to note that general matrix\u2013matrix mul-\ntiplication frequently predominates in deep learning computing\n[19,20]. Multiple input vectors must be combined into a single\nmatrix and multiplied simultaneously with a weight matrix to\nachieve optical matrix\u2013matrix multiplication. Therefore, VMM\nacceleration processors must operate sequentially or in parallel\n[19], which necessitates numerous computational cycles or mul-\ntiple parallel devices, but it has a large disadvantage in terms\nof computational efficiency or computational energy efficiency\nratio.\nObviously, the major way to improve the computational power\nand energy efficiency ratio of optical computing is by imple-\nmenting parallel computation of matrix\u2013matrix multiplication\nin a compact system.\nIn this paper, we propose a matrix\u2013matrix multiplication\nacceleration processor based on a WDM system and a non-\ncoherent MZI array. WDM devices are used to achieve the\ndimensional expansion of the input and output, which then\nenable matrix\u2013matrix multiplication to improve the paral-\nlel computational capability of the system. The non-coherent\nMZI array is implemented using dilated double-layer networks\n(DDLNs) [21], which can realize arbitrary nonnegative valued\nmatrices with low optical path loss and phase error accumu-\nlation.

We experimentally verified that this\nstructure could achieve 90.5% inference accuracy in the clas-\nsification task of the Modified National Institute of Standards\nand Technology (MNIST) handwritten dataset in the PNN. This\nprovides an effective network for a large-scale integrated optical\ncomputing system based on matrix\u2013matrix convolution.\nFigure 1(a) is a schematic diagram of the photonic neural\nnetwork, which consists of an input layer, hidden layers, and\nan output layer. Optical signals are encoded by light intensity\nthrough a data arrangement unit in the WDM-based non-\ncoherent architecture. The proposed 2 \u00d7 2 topology network of\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication is shown in Fig. 1(b), which is\ncomposed of four MZIs and four WDMs. The input data [x1, x2,\nx3, x4, . . . , xn] with the different wavelengths [\u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3, \u03bb4, . . . ,\n\u03bbn] are simultaneously fed into the photonic hidden layer for the\nconvolution of matrices. The output result based on different\nwavelengths is represented as yi. The basic unit of the network\nis an MZI with an adjustable beam splitting ratio ai, bi, ci, di, i\n\u2208(0, 1, 2, . . . , N) in the interval from 0 to 1. Each MZI consists\nof two multimode interferometers (MMIs) with transmissivity\nfixed at 50:50 and two phase shifters, where one of the phase-\nshift arms uses thermal tuning to change the phase and thus the\nbeam-splitting ratio of the MZI unit. Since the MZI topology is\nsimilar to the DDLN, it perfectly inherits the advantage of low\noptical path loss in that structure [21]. Moreover, the number\nof MZI cascades in the middle of this structure is only two in\nany dimension, which further reduces the influence of phase\nerror accumulation on the calculation results in combination\nwith non-coherent light. A mapping function is formed between\nthe input and output:\n[\ufe03\ny11\ny12\ny21\ny22\n]\ufe03\n=\n[\ufe03\na1b1\nc1(1 \u2212b1)\n(1 \u2212a1)d1\n(1 \u2212c1)(1 \u2212d1)\n]\ufe03\n\u00d7\n[\ufe03\nx11\nx12\nx21\nx22\n]\ufe03\n.\n(1)\nThe input data x11 and x21 represent the input signal of wave-\nlength \u03bb1, and x12 and x22 represent the input signal of wavelength\n\u03bb2. The output data y11 and y21 are the y1 and y2 channel output\npower of wavelength \u03bb1, and y12 and y22 are the y1 and y2 chan-\nnel output power of wavelength \u03bb2, respectively. The parameters\na1, b1, c1, and d1 represent the beam-splitting ratio of the four\nadjustable MZIs in the network. The external voltage is loaded\nto the adjustable phase shift arm to alter phase when the optical\nsignal is input from the upper port of the MZI. The MZI unit\nis in the cross-state when the \u03c0 phase shift is reached, and we\ndefine the splitting ratio as 0. The MZI is in a bar-state and the\nsplitting ratio is defined as 1 when the phase difference between\nthe two phase shifters is 0. At this point, the upper port of the\nMZI output can deliver the maximum output. The MZI array\nusing this method can produce an arbitrary nonnegative valued\nmatrix. Although the splitting ratios of the MZI units within the\nstructure require matrix-based computation, it is adaptable for\nreal-time updates in on-chip training applications. Furthermore,\ncompared with traditional Mesh arrays [8], the proposed method\nreduces the computational load associated with singular value\ndecomposition calculations.\nWe used a programmable 8 \u00d7 8 thermo-optical, Benes-\nnetwork-based MZI array [22] and four WDMs to validate\nthe topology of the proposed 2 \u00d7 2 topology network of\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication. On the one hand, the channel\ncenter wavelengths of our selected commercial WDM devices\n(Flyin) are 1310 nm and 1330 nm, respectively. It has a 0.5-dB\nbandwidth of 13 nm. We chose the two wavelengths close car-\nrier wavelengths of 1316.5 nm and 1323.5 nm, which reduced\nthe requirement for wide bandwidth in the MZI wavelength char-\nacteristics. On the other hand, the schematic illustration of the\nstructure of a 2 \u00d7 2 nonnegative valued matrix using an 8 \u00d7 8\nBenes network is shown in Fig. 2(a). The input data were simul-\ntaneously encoded at two wavelengths and fed into the MZI\narray. It transmitted the data to the tunable MZI units through\nthe red dotted line-based path of the MZI. We adjusted the a1, b1,\nc1, and d1 to operate under an arbitrary matrix and thus receive\ninformation at the output for both wavelengths. The MZI array\nwas fabricated on top of a silicon-on-insulator wafer using the\nCMOS process at the Singapore Advanced Micro Foundry. It\nhas a 220-nm top silicon layer and a 3-\u00b5m buried oxide layer.\nThe ridge waveguide has a width of 500 nm and a height of\n130 nm, with a phase-shifter arm width of 2 \u00b5m and a length\nof 100 \u00b5m. The thermo-optic resistor has a width of 2 \u00b5m and a\nP\u03c0 of 19 mW. Figure 2(b) shows the microscopy image of the\nfabricated 8 \u00d7 8 MZI arrays for the proposed 2 \u00d7 2 nonnegative\nvalued matrix.

The enlarged inset shows\nthe transmission spectrum between wavelengths 1316.5 nm and\n1323.5 nm.\ncalculated through a logical path to prevent it from being trans-\nmitted to the monitoring points, which can reduce power loss\nand calculation error.\nFigure 3 shows the transmission spectra of the cross port of\nthe MZI unit of the 8 \u00d7 8 MZI array at the wavelength range of\n1280 nm to 1360 nm, for bias voltages of 0 V, 1 V, 1.6 V, 2 V,\n2.5 V, and 3 V. The insertion loss of the MZI unit at 1310 nm\nis approximately \u22123.2 dB. As the voltage increases, the port\u2019s\noutput power decreases, and the trend is consistent with the ini-\ntial state. The enlarged image in Fig. 3 shows the difference of\n0.49 dB in the transmission power of the MZI unit at 1316.5 nm\nand 1323.5 nm. We can compensate for the error using the input\npower. Therefore, in the range of this wavelength, we can default\nthe response of the tunable MZI unit to be the same for different\nwavelengths of signals loaded with different bias voltages. It\ncan be inferred that the light intensity after the transmission is\nthe same for the whole MZI array for different wavelengths of\noptical signals, ensuring that signals of various wavelengths can\nbe multiplied by the same matrix. The fluctuations in the trans-\nmission spectrum may be attributed to reflections and scattering\noccurring at the interfaces of waveguide structures or grating\ncouplers, as well as to environmental factors.\nThe experimental setup for the system validation is shown\nin Fig. 4. We demonstrated the computation of multiplication\nand addition of 2 \u00d7 2 matrices based on the MNIST handwrit-\nten digits dataset. The result of this computation is the first\nconvolutional layer in the PNN model for the task of handwrit-\nten digit recognition and classification. For each image in the\ndataset, there were 28 \u00d7 28 gray scale pixel values to be calcu-\nlated. These values were normalized and encoded as coefficients\nof one-dimensional radio frequency (RF) signals in a specific\norder. The RF signals output from an arbitrary waveform gen-\nerator (AWG, Keysight M8194A) were amplified by microwave\namplifiers (SHF 804B) and were loaded onto commercial mod-\nulators (iXblue MX1300-LN-40). By using DC voltage, the\nmodulators were set to operate at a 3-dB operating point. A\nmaximum calculation rate of 40 GMAC/s was possible thanks\nto the AWG\u2019s sampling rate of 100 GSa/s and the input data\u2019s\nsampling rate of 20 samples per symbol (sps).

The optical signal containing the input-data informa-\ntion was obtained from the modulator and fed to two independent\nWDMs. The output optical signals of the WDMs were verti-\ncally coupled to the chip using a fiber array. The on-chip loss at\n1310 nm is approximately \u221216.2 dB. Finally, the optical signals\ncarrying the calculation results were demultiplexed by WDMs,\nand the optical signals of different wavelengths were fed into\na praseodymium-doped fiber amplifier (AMP-FL8611-OB-20)\nfor amplification. A balanced photoelectric detector (Finisar\nBPDV2120R) then turned these into electrical signals, which\nwere then detected by a real-time oscilloscope (UXR0594A,\n256 GSa/s, 59 GHz bandwidth). Using a computer, the collected\nwaveforms were time-synchronized, down-sampled to 1 sps, and\nthen transferred to the PNN\u2019s next layer.\nFigure 5(a) illustrates the architecture of the PNN of our chip\nfor image recognition tasks. It consists of an input layer, two\nconvolution layers, two fully connected layers, and an output\nlayer. The optical matrix multiplication and addition opera-\ntions are the first convolution layer. The 28 \u00d7 28 gray scale\nimages were encoded as 784 \u00d7 20 vectors and fed into the opti-\ncal matrix\u2013matrix multiplier in four groups sequentially. The\ncalculation\u2019s output was transferred to the hidden layer below\nafter being down-sampled to a value of 784 \u00d7 1. The output\nlayer divided the data into 10 groups that correspond to the\nintegers 0 to 9. The simulation model was built in PyTorch\n[23] and trained by a stochastic gradient descent optimizer with\na learning rate of 0.005. The activation function used in the\nPNN model was rectified linear unit [24].

The accuracy is not only influenced by errors\nin input encoding, output data extraction, and device insertion\nloss during testing, but also closely related to factors such as\nthe PNN network structure and training parameters. In future\nresearch, accuracy can be further improved by optimizing these\naspects.\nIn conclusion, we have presented a novel, to the best of\nour knowledge, 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix multiplication acceleration\nprocessor that uses a WDM system and a non-coherent MZI\narray. The WDM devices enable the extension of the input and\noutput dimensions, and the wide bandwidth of MZI devices\nallows different wavelengths to function properly within the\noptical computing chip. This enables matrix\u2013matrix multiplica-\ntion and addition operations, thereby enhancing the parallelism\nand computational power of optical computing. In our sys-\ntem, a nonnegative weight matrix is cleverly implemented\nusing a dilated double-layer-based MZI array, inheriting the\nadvantages of this structure in terms of optical path loss.\nWe have experimentally demonstrated the feasibility of this\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication acceleration processor by using\nit to perform image recognition on handwritten digits from\nthe MNIST dataset and have achieved an inference accuracy\nof 90.5% with a computing rate of 40 GMAC/s. Consid-\nering the encoding of digital-to-analog converters and the\nsampling of analog-to-digital converters, their time overhead\ndoes not increase with the matrix scale N. Nevertheless, the\ncomputational capacity of the proposed structure grows propor-\ntionally to N2, thereby emphasizing its advantages in large-scale\narrays. This represents a promising solution for large-scale\nintegrated optical computing systems based on matrix\u2013matrix\nconvolution.\nFunding.\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China\n(Grant No. 2021YFA1401200); National Natural Science Foundation\nof China (62035001); Chongqing Science and Technology Foundation\n(cstc2020jscx-cy1hX0006).\nDisclosures.\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\nData availability.\nThe data concerning the results presented in this paper\nare not available publicly at this time, but the same could be made available\nfrom the authors upon reasonable request.\nREFERENCES\n1.

This provides a new effective solution\nfor large-scale integrated optical computing systems based\non convolution acceleration processors.\n\u00a9 2023 Optica Pub-\nlishing Group\nhttps://doi.org/10.1364/OL.488464\nThe requirement for computing power is rising in tandem with\nthe expansion of artificial intelligence applications [1,2]. Elec-\ntronic devices are unable to meet the aforementioned standards\nbecause they are limited by the speed of traditional microelec-\ntronic processors. The photon has become a new topic of study as\nan information carrier [3\u20135]. Matrix multiplications and addition\ncalculations are performed by photonic acceleration processors\nutilizing photonic devices [6,7], which can further be combined\nwith electrical devices to build photonic neural networks (PNNs)\nfor artificial intelligence applications. As a result, it is anticipated\nthat a photonic acceleration processor will operate quicker and\nmore efficiently than its electrical counterpart.\nIn the majority of the recent research on photonic acceleration\nprocessors, photonic devices have been used to realize vector-\nmatrix multiplication (VMM). These processors are primarily\nimplemented by Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer (MZI) arrays\n[8\u201312] and parallel computing systems based on wavelength\ndivision multiplexer (WDM) technology [13\u201318]. However,\nMZI arrays are currently implemented mainly by coherent light,\nwhich has the defects of high impact of phase error accumula-\ntion, low scalability, and high impact by off-chip optical phase.\nCurrently, optical systems implemented based on WDM technol-\nogy mainly use micro-ring weight banks or crossbar structures\nof phase change materials to implement weight matrices. How-\never, the micro-ring array has phase sensitivity problems, which\ngreatly increases the difficulty of realization. The computational\nunit of phase change materials is not easily compatible with the\ntraditional complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)\nprocess. These systems can only realize the multiplication and\naddition of one vector and matrix at each operation, which has\nthe problem of insufficient arithmetic power. In the current mod-\nels, the major way to increase the arithmetic power is to increase\nthe scale of the computational chip, which has large hardware\nerrors such as additional packaging and electrical power con-\nsumption problems. Therefore, it is challenging to realize a\nhigher computational power integrated optical computing chip\n[14].\nAlthough the above-mentioned systems emphasize VMM\nacceleration, it is crucial to note that general matrix\u2013matrix mul-\ntiplication frequently predominates in deep learning computing\n[19,20]. Multiple input vectors must be combined into a single\nmatrix and multiplied simultaneously with a weight matrix to\nachieve optical matrix\u2013matrix multiplication. Therefore, VMM\nacceleration processors must operate sequentially or in parallel\n[19], which necessitates numerous computational cycles or mul-\ntiple parallel devices, but it has a large disadvantage in terms\nof computational efficiency or computational energy efficiency\nratio.\nObviously, the major way to improve the computational power\nand energy efficiency ratio of optical computing is by imple-\nmenting parallel computation of matrix\u2013matrix multiplication\nin a compact system.\nIn this paper, we propose a matrix\u2013matrix multiplication\nacceleration processor based on a WDM system and a non-\ncoherent MZI array. WDM devices are used to achieve the\ndimensional expansion of the input and output, which then\nenable matrix\u2013matrix multiplication to improve the paral-\nlel computational capability of the system. The non-coherent\nMZI array is implemented using dilated double-layer networks\n(DDLNs) [21], which can realize arbitrary nonnegative valued\nmatrices with low optical path loss and phase error accumu-\nlation.

We experimentally verified that this\nstructure could achieve 90.5% inference accuracy in the clas-\nsification task of the Modified National Institute of Standards\nand Technology (MNIST) handwritten dataset in the PNN. This\nprovides an effective network for a large-scale integrated optical\ncomputing system based on matrix\u2013matrix convolution.\nFigure 1(a) is a schematic diagram of the photonic neural\nnetwork, which consists of an input layer, hidden layers, and\nan output layer. Optical signals are encoded by light intensity\nthrough a data arrangement unit in the WDM-based non-\ncoherent architecture. The proposed 2 \u00d7 2 topology network of\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication is shown in Fig. 1(b), which is\ncomposed of four MZIs and four WDMs. The input data [x1, x2,\nx3, x4, . . . , xn] with the different wavelengths [\u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3, \u03bb4, . . . ,\n\u03bbn] are simultaneously fed into the photonic hidden layer for the\nconvolution of matrices. The output result based on different\nwavelengths is represented as yi. The basic unit of the network\nis an MZI with an adjustable beam splitting ratio ai, bi, ci, di, i\n\u2208(0, 1, 2, . . . , N) in the interval from 0 to 1. Each MZI consists\nof two multimode interferometers (MMIs) with transmissivity\nfixed at 50:50 and two phase shifters, where one of the phase-\nshift arms uses thermal tuning to change the phase and thus the\nbeam-splitting ratio of the MZI unit. Since the MZI topology is\nsimilar to the DDLN, it perfectly inherits the advantage of low\noptical path loss in that structure [21]. Moreover, the number\nof MZI cascades in the middle of this structure is only two in\nany dimension, which further reduces the influence of phase\nerror accumulation on the calculation results in combination\nwith non-coherent light. A mapping function is formed between\nthe input and output:\n[\ufe03\ny11\ny12\ny21\ny22\n]\ufe03\n=\n[\ufe03\na1b1\nc1(1 \u2212b1)\n(1 \u2212a1)d1\n(1 \u2212c1)(1 \u2212d1)\n]\ufe03\n\u00d7\n[\ufe03\nx11\nx12\nx21\nx22\n]\ufe03\n.\n(1)\nThe input data x11 and x21 represent the input signal of wave-\nlength \u03bb1, and x12 and x22 represent the input signal of wavelength\n\u03bb2. The output data y11 and y21 are the y1 and y2 channel output\npower of wavelength \u03bb1, and y12 and y22 are the y1 and y2 chan-\nnel output power of wavelength \u03bb2, respectively. The parameters\na1, b1, c1, and d1 represent the beam-splitting ratio of the four\nadjustable MZIs in the network. The external voltage is loaded\nto the adjustable phase shift arm to alter phase when the optical\nsignal is input from the upper port of the MZI. The MZI unit\nis in the cross-state when the \u03c0 phase shift is reached, and we\ndefine the splitting ratio as 0. The MZI is in a bar-state and the\nsplitting ratio is defined as 1 when the phase difference between\nthe two phase shifters is 0. At this point, the upper port of the\nMZI output can deliver the maximum output. The MZI array\nusing this method can produce an arbitrary nonnegative valued\nmatrix. Although the splitting ratios of the MZI units within the\nstructure require matrix-based computation, it is adaptable for\nreal-time updates in on-chip training applications. Furthermore,\ncompared with traditional Mesh arrays [8], the proposed method\nreduces the computational load associated with singular value\ndecomposition calculations.\nWe used a programmable 8 \u00d7 8 thermo-optical, Benes-\nnetwork-based MZI array [22] and four WDMs to validate\nthe topology of the proposed 2 \u00d7 2 topology network of\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication. On the one hand, the channel\ncenter wavelengths of our selected commercial WDM devices\n(Flyin) are 1310 nm and 1330 nm, respectively. It has a 0.5-dB\nbandwidth of 13 nm. We chose the two wavelengths close car-\nrier wavelengths of 1316.5 nm and 1323.5 nm, which reduced\nthe requirement for wide bandwidth in the MZI wavelength char-\nacteristics. On the other hand, the schematic illustration of the\nstructure of a 2 \u00d7 2 nonnegative valued matrix using an 8 \u00d7 8\nBenes network is shown in Fig. 2(a). The input data were simul-\ntaneously encoded at two wavelengths and fed into the MZI\narray. It transmitted the data to the tunable MZI units through\nthe red dotted line-based path of the MZI. We adjusted the a1, b1,\nc1, and d1 to operate under an arbitrary matrix and thus receive\ninformation at the output for both wavelengths. The MZI array\nwas fabricated on top of a silicon-on-insulator wafer using the\nCMOS process at the Singapore Advanced Micro Foundry. It\nhas a 220-nm top silicon layer and a 3-\u00b5m buried oxide layer.\nThe ridge waveguide has a width of 500 nm and a height of\n130 nm, with a phase-shifter arm width of 2 \u00b5m and a length\nof 100 \u00b5m. The thermo-optic resistor has a width of 2 \u00b5m and a\nP\u03c0 of 19 mW. Figure 2(b) shows the microscopy image of the\nfabricated 8 \u00d7 8 MZI arrays for the proposed 2 \u00d7 2 nonnegative\nvalued matrix. The inset in Fig. 2(b) depicts a magnified image of\nthe MZI unit. Both phase shift arms are tunable, however, only\na single tunable phase shifter was loaded with voltage in the\nexperiment. We have pre-tested all the MZI states by a grating-\npower monitor in the array. Additionally, the signal should be\nFig. 2.\nSchematic of the fabricated device.

The enlarged inset shows\nthe transmission spectrum between wavelengths 1316.5 nm and\n1323.5 nm.\ncalculated through a logical path to prevent it from being trans-\nmitted to the monitoring points, which can reduce power loss\nand calculation error.\nFigure 3 shows the transmission spectra of the cross port of\nthe MZI unit of the 8 \u00d7 8 MZI array at the wavelength range of\n1280 nm to 1360 nm, for bias voltages of 0 V, 1 V, 1.6 V, 2 V,\n2.5 V, and 3 V. The insertion loss of the MZI unit at 1310 nm\nis approximately \u22123.2 dB. As the voltage increases, the port\u2019s\noutput power decreases, and the trend is consistent with the ini-\ntial state. The enlarged image in Fig. 3 shows the difference of\n0.49 dB in the transmission power of the MZI unit at 1316.5 nm\nand 1323.5 nm. We can compensate for the error using the input\npower. Therefore, in the range of this wavelength, we can default\nthe response of the tunable MZI unit to be the same for different\nwavelengths of signals loaded with different bias voltages. It\ncan be inferred that the light intensity after the transmission is\nthe same for the whole MZI array for different wavelengths of\noptical signals, ensuring that signals of various wavelengths can\nbe multiplied by the same matrix. The fluctuations in the trans-\nmission spectrum may be attributed to reflections and scattering\noccurring at the interfaces of waveguide structures or grating\ncouplers, as well as to environmental factors.\nThe experimental setup for the system validation is shown\nin Fig. 4. We demonstrated the computation of multiplication\nand addition of 2 \u00d7 2 matrices based on the MNIST handwrit-\nten digits dataset. The result of this computation is the first\nconvolutional layer in the PNN model for the task of handwrit-\nten digit recognition and classification. For each image in the\ndataset, there were 28 \u00d7 28 gray scale pixel values to be calcu-\nlated. These values were normalized and encoded as coefficients\nof one-dimensional radio frequency (RF) signals in a specific\norder. The RF signals output from an arbitrary waveform gen-\nerator (AWG, Keysight M8194A) were amplified by microwave\namplifiers (SHF 804B) and were loaded onto commercial mod-\nulators (iXblue MX1300-LN-40). By using DC voltage, the\nmodulators were set to operate at a 3-dB operating point. A\nmaximum calculation rate of 40 GMAC/s was possible thanks\nto the AWG\u2019s sampling rate of 100 GSa/s and the input data\u2019s\nsampling rate of 20 samples per symbol (sps). The output from\nFig. 4.\nSchematic diagram of the experimental system for pho-\ntonic matrix\u2013matrix multiplication in PNNs.

The optical signal containing the input-data informa-\ntion was obtained from the modulator and fed to two independent\nWDMs. The output optical signals of the WDMs were verti-\ncally coupled to the chip using a fiber array. The on-chip loss at\n1310 nm is approximately \u221216.2 dB. Finally, the optical signals\ncarrying the calculation results were demultiplexed by WDMs,\nand the optical signals of different wavelengths were fed into\na praseodymium-doped fiber amplifier (AMP-FL8611-OB-20)\nfor amplification. A balanced photoelectric detector (Finisar\nBPDV2120R) then turned these into electrical signals, which\nwere then detected by a real-time oscilloscope (UXR0594A,\n256 GSa/s, 59 GHz bandwidth). Using a computer, the collected\nwaveforms were time-synchronized, down-sampled to 1 sps, and\nthen transferred to the PNN\u2019s next layer.\nFigure 5(a) illustrates the architecture of the PNN of our chip\nfor image recognition tasks. It consists of an input layer, two\nconvolution layers, two fully connected layers, and an output\nlayer. The optical matrix multiplication and addition opera-\ntions are the first convolution layer. The 28 \u00d7 28 gray scale\nimages were encoded as 784 \u00d7 20 vectors and fed into the opti-\ncal matrix\u2013matrix multiplier in four groups sequentially. The\ncalculation\u2019s output was transferred to the hidden layer below\nafter being down-sampled to a value of 784 \u00d7 1. The output\nlayer divided the data into 10 groups that correspond to the\nintegers 0 to 9. The simulation model was built in PyTorch\n[23] and trained by a stochastic gradient descent optimizer with\na learning rate of 0.005. The activation function used in the\nPNN model was rectified linear unit [24]. The real-time com-\nputational results of the y11 port are shown in Fig. 5(b) when\nthe computational data of the x11 channel are supplied. The red\nsolid curve is the result obtained from the simulation and the\nblue dashed curve is the experimentally obtained time trajectory.\nWithin 20 ns continually, the computed data essentially match\nthe simulated data, indicating great computation accuracy for a\ncomputing rate of 40 GMAC/s. A 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix convolu-\ntion calculation implemented in an optical system was used to\nbuild a PNN to classify handwritten digits in the dataset MNIST.\nThe dataset was divided into a training set and a test set. Our\nmodel had been trained on the whole training set, and 200 sam-\nples from the test set were used to check the precision of the\nresults computed on the chip. Figure 5(c) shows their confu-\nsion matrix on the test samples. We can get 90.5% accuracy\nfor handwritten digit recognition, which is closer to the training\n3234\nVol. 48, No. 12 / 15 June 2023 / Optics Letters\nLetter\nFig. 5.\nMNIST handwritten digit classification task experiment:\n(a) architecture of the convolution neural network; (b) the y11-\nchannel output time trace of 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix at 40 GMAC/s\nwith single-channel input x1 for MNIST handwritten digit classi-\nfication task; (c) the confusion matrix by the 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix\nPNN model.\nresult (92.7%). The accuracy is not only influenced by errors\nin input encoding, output data extraction, and device insertion\nloss during testing, but also closely related to factors such as\nthe PNN network structure and training parameters. In future\nresearch, accuracy can be further improved by optimizing these\naspects.\nIn conclusion, we have presented a novel, to the best of\nour knowledge, 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix multiplication acceleration\nprocessor that uses a WDM system and a non-coherent MZI\narray. The WDM devices enable the extension of the input and\noutput dimensions, and the wide bandwidth of MZI devices\nallows different wavelengths to function properly within the\noptical computing chip. This enables matrix\u2013matrix multiplica-\ntion and addition operations, thereby enhancing the parallelism\nand computational power of optical computing. In our sys-\ntem, a nonnegative weight matrix is cleverly implemented\nusing a dilated double-layer-based MZI array, inheriting the\nadvantages of this structure in terms of optical path loss.\nWe have experimentally demonstrated the feasibility of this\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication acceleration processor by using\nit to perform image recognition on handwritten digits from\nthe MNIST dataset and have achieved an inference accuracy\nof 90.5% with a computing rate of 40 GMAC/s. Consid-\nering the encoding of digital-to-analog converters and the\nsampling of analog-to-digital converters, their time overhead\ndoes not increase with the matrix scale N. Nevertheless, the\ncomputational capacity of the proposed structure grows propor-\ntionally to N2, thereby emphasizing its advantages in large-scale\narrays. This represents a promising solution for large-scale\nintegrated optical computing systems based on matrix\u2013matrix\nconvolution.\nFunding.\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China\n(Grant No. 2021YFA1401200); National Natural Science Foundation\nof China (62035001); Chongqing Science and Technology Foundation\n(cstc2020jscx-cy1hX0006).\nDisclosures.\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\nData availability.\nThe data concerning the results presented in this paper\nare not available publicly at this time, but the same could be made available\nfrom the authors upon reasonable request.\nREFERENCES\n1.

The dimensional expansion\nis achieved by WDM devices, which play a crucial role in\nrealizing matrix\u2013matrix multiplication together with the\nbroadband characteristics of an MZI. We implemented a\n2 \u00d7 2 arbitrary nonnegative valued matrix using a reconfig-\nurable 8 \u00d7 8 MZI array structure. Through experimentation,\nwe verified that this structure could achieve 90.5% infer-\nence accuracy in a classification task for the Modified\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST)\nhandwritten dataset. This provides a new effective solution\nfor large-scale integrated optical computing systems based\non convolution acceleration processors.\n\u00a9 2023 Optica Pub-\nlishing Group\nhttps://doi.org/10.1364/OL.488464\nThe requirement for computing power is rising in tandem with\nthe expansion of artificial intelligence applications [1,2]. Elec-\ntronic devices are unable to meet the aforementioned standards\nbecause they are limited by the speed of traditional microelec-\ntronic processors. The photon has become a new topic of study as\nan information carrier [3\u20135]. Matrix multiplications and addition\ncalculations are performed by photonic acceleration processors\nutilizing photonic devices [6,7], which can further be combined\nwith electrical devices to build photonic neural networks (PNNs)\nfor artificial intelligence applications. As a result, it is anticipated\nthat a photonic acceleration processor will operate quicker and\nmore efficiently than its electrical counterpart.\nIn the majority of the recent research on photonic acceleration\nprocessors, photonic devices have been used to realize vector-\nmatrix multiplication (VMM). These processors are primarily\nimplemented by Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer (MZI) arrays\n[8\u201312] and parallel computing systems based on wavelength\ndivision multiplexer (WDM) technology [13\u201318]. However,\nMZI arrays are currently implemented mainly by coherent light,\nwhich has the defects of high impact of phase error accumula-\ntion, low scalability, and high impact by off-chip optical phase.\nCurrently, optical systems implemented based on WDM technol-\nogy mainly use micro-ring weight banks or crossbar structures\nof phase change materials to implement weight matrices. How-\never, the micro-ring array has phase sensitivity problems, which\ngreatly increases the difficulty of realization. The computational\nunit of phase change materials is not easily compatible with the\ntraditional complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)\nprocess. These systems can only realize the multiplication and\naddition of one vector and matrix at each operation, which has\nthe problem of insufficient arithmetic power. In the current mod-\nels, the major way to increase the arithmetic power is to increase\nthe scale of the computational chip, which has large hardware\nerrors such as additional packaging and electrical power con-\nsumption problems. Therefore, it is challenging to realize a\nhigher computational power integrated optical computing chip\n[14].\nAlthough the above-mentioned systems emphasize VMM\nacceleration, it is crucial to note that general matrix\u2013matrix mul-\ntiplication frequently predominates in deep learning computing\n[19,20]. Multiple input vectors must be combined into a single\nmatrix and multiplied simultaneously with a weight matrix to\nachieve optical matrix\u2013matrix multiplication. Therefore, VMM\nacceleration processors must operate sequentially or in parallel\n[19], which necessitates numerous computational cycles or mul-\ntiple parallel devices, but it has a large disadvantage in terms\nof computational efficiency or computational energy efficiency\nratio.\nObviously, the major way to improve the computational power\nand energy efficiency ratio of optical computing is by imple-\nmenting parallel computation of matrix\u2013matrix multiplication\nin a compact system.\nIn this paper, we propose a matrix\u2013matrix multiplication\nacceleration processor based on a WDM system and a non-\ncoherent MZI array. WDM devices are used to achieve the\ndimensional expansion of the input and output, which then\nenable matrix\u2013matrix multiplication to improve the paral-\nlel computational capability of the system. The non-coherent\nMZI array is implemented using dilated double-layer networks\n(DDLNs) [21], which can realize arbitrary nonnegative valued\nmatrices with low optical path loss and phase error accumu-\nlation. We implemented a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix multiplier of\n0146-9592/23/123231-04 Journal \u00a9 2023 Optica Publishing Group\n3232\nVol. 48, No. 12 / 15 June 2023 / Optics Letters\nLetter\nFig. 1.\nSchematic of photonic acceleration processor: (a) a\nphotonic neural network; (b) a photonic acceleration processor.\nnonnegative values using an 8 \u00d7 8 programmable MZI array as\nwell as four WDM devices. We experimentally verified that this\nstructure could achieve 90.5% inference accuracy in the clas-\nsification task of the Modified National Institute of Standards\nand Technology (MNIST) handwritten dataset in the PNN. This\nprovides an effective network for a large-scale integrated optical\ncomputing system based on matrix\u2013matrix convolution.\nFigure 1(a) is a schematic diagram of the photonic neural\nnetwork, which consists of an input layer, hidden layers, and\nan output layer. Optical signals are encoded by light intensity\nthrough a data arrangement unit in the WDM-based non-\ncoherent architecture. The proposed 2 \u00d7 2 topology network of\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication is shown in Fig. 1(b), which is\ncomposed of four MZIs and four WDMs. The input data [x1, x2,\nx3, x4, . . . , xn] with the different wavelengths [\u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3, \u03bb4, . . . ,\n\u03bbn] are simultaneously fed into the photonic hidden layer for the\nconvolution of matrices. The output result based on different\nwavelengths is represented as yi. The basic unit of the network\nis an MZI with an adjustable beam splitting ratio ai, bi, ci, di, i\n\u2208(0, 1, 2, . . . , N) in the interval from 0 to 1. Each MZI consists\nof two multimode interferometers (MMIs) with transmissivity\nfixed at 50:50 and two phase shifters, where one of the phase-\nshift arms uses thermal tuning to change the phase and thus the\nbeam-splitting ratio of the MZI unit. Since the MZI topology is\nsimilar to the DDLN, it perfectly inherits the advantage of low\noptical path loss in that structure [21]. Moreover, the number\nof MZI cascades in the middle of this structure is only two in\nany dimension, which further reduces the influence of phase\nerror accumulation on the calculation results in combination\nwith non-coherent light. A mapping function is formed between\nthe input and output:\n[\ufe03\ny11\ny12\ny21\ny22\n]\ufe03\n=\n[\ufe03\na1b1\nc1(1 \u2212b1)\n(1 \u2212a1)d1\n(1 \u2212c1)(1 \u2212d1)\n]\ufe03\n\u00d7\n[\ufe03\nx11\nx12\nx21\nx22\n]\ufe03\n.\n(1)\nThe input data x11 and x21 represent the input signal of wave-\nlength \u03bb1, and x12 and x22 represent the input signal of wavelength\n\u03bb2. The output data y11 and y21 are the y1 and y2 channel output\npower of wavelength \u03bb1, and y12 and y22 are the y1 and y2 chan-\nnel output power of wavelength \u03bb2, respectively. The parameters\na1, b1, c1, and d1 represent the beam-splitting ratio of the four\nadjustable MZIs in the network. The external voltage is loaded\nto the adjustable phase shift arm to alter phase when the optical\nsignal is input from the upper port of the MZI. The MZI unit\nis in the cross-state when the \u03c0 phase shift is reached, and we\ndefine the splitting ratio as 0. The MZI is in a bar-state and the\nsplitting ratio is defined as 1 when the phase difference between\nthe two phase shifters is 0. At this point, the upper port of the\nMZI output can deliver the maximum output. The MZI array\nusing this method can produce an arbitrary nonnegative valued\nmatrix. Although the splitting ratios of the MZI units within the\nstructure require matrix-based computation, it is adaptable for\nreal-time updates in on-chip training applications. Furthermore,\ncompared with traditional Mesh arrays [8], the proposed method\nreduces the computational load associated with singular value\ndecomposition calculations.\nWe used a programmable 8 \u00d7 8 thermo-optical, Benes-\nnetwork-based MZI array [22] and four WDMs to validate\nthe topology of the proposed 2 \u00d7 2 topology network of\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication. On the one hand, the channel\ncenter wavelengths of our selected commercial WDM devices\n(Flyin) are 1310 nm and 1330 nm, respectively. It has a 0.5-dB\nbandwidth of 13 nm. We chose the two wavelengths close car-\nrier wavelengths of 1316.5 nm and 1323.5 nm, which reduced\nthe requirement for wide bandwidth in the MZI wavelength char-\nacteristics. On the other hand, the schematic illustration of the\nstructure of a 2 \u00d7 2 nonnegative valued matrix using an 8 \u00d7 8\nBenes network is shown in Fig. 2(a). The input data were simul-\ntaneously encoded at two wavelengths and fed into the MZI\narray. It transmitted the data to the tunable MZI units through\nthe red dotted line-based path of the MZI. We adjusted the a1, b1,\nc1, and d1 to operate under an arbitrary matrix and thus receive\ninformation at the output for both wavelengths. The MZI array\nwas fabricated on top of a silicon-on-insulator wafer using the\nCMOS process at the Singapore Advanced Micro Foundry. It\nhas a 220-nm top silicon layer and a 3-\u00b5m buried oxide layer.\nThe ridge waveguide has a width of 500 nm and a height of\n130 nm, with a phase-shifter arm width of 2 \u00b5m and a length\nof 100 \u00b5m. The thermo-optic resistor has a width of 2 \u00b5m and a\nP\u03c0 of 19 mW. Figure 2(b) shows the microscopy image of the\nfabricated 8 \u00d7 8 MZI arrays for the proposed 2 \u00d7 2 nonnegative\nvalued matrix. The inset in Fig. 2(b) depicts a magnified image of\nthe MZI unit. Both phase shift arms are tunable, however, only\na single tunable phase shifter was loaded with voltage in the\nexperiment. We have pre-tested all the MZI states by a grating-\npower monitor in the array. Additionally, the signal should be\nFig. 2.\nSchematic of the fabricated device.

The inset is an enlarged illustration of the\nMZI unit.\nLetter\nVol. 48, No. 12 / 15 June 2023 / Optics Letters\n3233\nFig. 3.\nWavelength dependence transmission spectrum of the\nMZI unit with different bias voltages. The enlarged inset shows\nthe transmission spectrum between wavelengths 1316.5 nm and\n1323.5 nm.\ncalculated through a logical path to prevent it from being trans-\nmitted to the monitoring points, which can reduce power loss\nand calculation error.\nFigure 3 shows the transmission spectra of the cross port of\nthe MZI unit of the 8 \u00d7 8 MZI array at the wavelength range of\n1280 nm to 1360 nm, for bias voltages of 0 V, 1 V, 1.6 V, 2 V,\n2.5 V, and 3 V. The insertion loss of the MZI unit at 1310 nm\nis approximately \u22123.2 dB. As the voltage increases, the port\u2019s\noutput power decreases, and the trend is consistent with the ini-\ntial state. The enlarged image in Fig. 3 shows the difference of\n0.49 dB in the transmission power of the MZI unit at 1316.5 nm\nand 1323.5 nm. We can compensate for the error using the input\npower. Therefore, in the range of this wavelength, we can default\nthe response of the tunable MZI unit to be the same for different\nwavelengths of signals loaded with different bias voltages. It\ncan be inferred that the light intensity after the transmission is\nthe same for the whole MZI array for different wavelengths of\noptical signals, ensuring that signals of various wavelengths can\nbe multiplied by the same matrix. The fluctuations in the trans-\nmission spectrum may be attributed to reflections and scattering\noccurring at the interfaces of waveguide structures or grating\ncouplers, as well as to environmental factors.\nThe experimental setup for the system validation is shown\nin Fig. 4. We demonstrated the computation of multiplication\nand addition of 2 \u00d7 2 matrices based on the MNIST handwrit-\nten digits dataset. The result of this computation is the first\nconvolutional layer in the PNN model for the task of handwrit-\nten digit recognition and classification. For each image in the\ndataset, there were 28 \u00d7 28 gray scale pixel values to be calcu-\nlated. These values were normalized and encoded as coefficients\nof one-dimensional radio frequency (RF) signals in a specific\norder. The RF signals output from an arbitrary waveform gen-\nerator (AWG, Keysight M8194A) were amplified by microwave\namplifiers (SHF 804B) and were loaded onto commercial mod-\nulators (iXblue MX1300-LN-40). By using DC voltage, the\nmodulators were set to operate at a 3-dB operating point. A\nmaximum calculation rate of 40 GMAC/s was possible thanks\nto the AWG\u2019s sampling rate of 100 GSa/s and the input data\u2019s\nsampling rate of 20 samples per symbol (sps).

The optical signal containing the input-data informa-\ntion was obtained from the modulator and fed to two independent\nWDMs. The output optical signals of the WDMs were verti-\ncally coupled to the chip using a fiber array. The on-chip loss at\n1310 nm is approximately \u221216.2 dB. Finally, the optical signals\ncarrying the calculation results were demultiplexed by WDMs,\nand the optical signals of different wavelengths were fed into\na praseodymium-doped fiber amplifier (AMP-FL8611-OB-20)\nfor amplification. A balanced photoelectric detector (Finisar\nBPDV2120R) then turned these into electrical signals, which\nwere then detected by a real-time oscilloscope (UXR0594A,\n256 GSa/s, 59 GHz bandwidth). Using a computer, the collected\nwaveforms were time-synchronized, down-sampled to 1 sps, and\nthen transferred to the PNN\u2019s next layer.\nFigure 5(a) illustrates the architecture of the PNN of our chip\nfor image recognition tasks. It consists of an input layer, two\nconvolution layers, two fully connected layers, and an output\nlayer. The optical matrix multiplication and addition opera-\ntions are the first convolution layer. The 28 \u00d7 28 gray scale\nimages were encoded as 784 \u00d7 20 vectors and fed into the opti-\ncal matrix\u2013matrix multiplier in four groups sequentially. The\ncalculation\u2019s output was transferred to the hidden layer below\nafter being down-sampled to a value of 784 \u00d7 1. The output\nlayer divided the data into 10 groups that correspond to the\nintegers 0 to 9. The simulation model was built in PyTorch\n[23] and trained by a stochastic gradient descent optimizer with\na learning rate of 0.005. The activation function used in the\nPNN model was rectified linear unit [24]. The real-time com-\nputational results of the y11 port are shown in Fig. 5(b) when\nthe computational data of the x11 channel are supplied. The red\nsolid curve is the result obtained from the simulation and the\nblue dashed curve is the experimentally obtained time trajectory.\nWithin 20 ns continually, the computed data essentially match\nthe simulated data, indicating great computation accuracy for a\ncomputing rate of 40 GMAC/s. A 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix convolu-\ntion calculation implemented in an optical system was used to\nbuild a PNN to classify handwritten digits in the dataset MNIST.\nThe dataset was divided into a training set and a test set. Our\nmodel had been trained on the whole training set, and 200 sam-\nples from the test set were used to check the precision of the\nresults computed on the chip.

The accuracy is not only influenced by errors\nin input encoding, output data extraction, and device insertion\nloss during testing, but also closely related to factors such as\nthe PNN network structure and training parameters. In future\nresearch, accuracy can be further improved by optimizing these\naspects.\nIn conclusion, we have presented a novel, to the best of\nour knowledge, 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix multiplication acceleration\nprocessor that uses a WDM system and a non-coherent MZI\narray. The WDM devices enable the extension of the input and\noutput dimensions, and the wide bandwidth of MZI devices\nallows different wavelengths to function properly within the\noptical computing chip. This enables matrix\u2013matrix multiplica-\ntion and addition operations, thereby enhancing the parallelism\nand computational power of optical computing. In our sys-\ntem, a nonnegative weight matrix is cleverly implemented\nusing a dilated double-layer-based MZI array, inheriting the\nadvantages of this structure in terms of optical path loss.\nWe have experimentally demonstrated the feasibility of this\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication acceleration processor by using\nit to perform image recognition on handwritten digits from\nthe MNIST dataset and have achieved an inference accuracy\nof 90.5% with a computing rate of 40 GMAC/s. Consid-\nering the encoding of digital-to-analog converters and the\nsampling of analog-to-digital converters, their time overhead\ndoes not increase with the matrix scale N. Nevertheless, the\ncomputational capacity of the proposed structure grows propor-\ntionally to N2, thereby emphasizing its advantages in large-scale\narrays.

The dimensional expansion\nis achieved by WDM devices, which play a crucial role in\nrealizing matrix\u2013matrix multiplication together with the\nbroadband characteristics of an MZI. We implemented a\n2 \u00d7 2 arbitrary nonnegative valued matrix using a reconfig-\nurable 8 \u00d7 8 MZI array structure. Through experimentation,\nwe verified that this structure could achieve 90.5% infer-\nence accuracy in a classification task for the Modified\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST)\nhandwritten dataset. This provides a new effective solution\nfor large-scale integrated optical computing systems based\non convolution acceleration processors.\n\u00a9 2023 Optica Pub-\nlishing Group\nhttps://doi.org/10.1364/OL.488464\nThe requirement for computing power is rising in tandem with\nthe expansion of artificial intelligence applications [1,2]. Elec-\ntronic devices are unable to meet the aforementioned standards\nbecause they are limited by the speed of traditional microelec-\ntronic processors. The photon has become a new topic of study as\nan information carrier [3\u20135]. Matrix multiplications and addition\ncalculations are performed by photonic acceleration processors\nutilizing photonic devices [6,7], which can further be combined\nwith electrical devices to build photonic neural networks (PNNs)\nfor artificial intelligence applications. As a result, it is anticipated\nthat a photonic acceleration processor will operate quicker and\nmore efficiently than its electrical counterpart.\nIn the majority of the recent research on photonic acceleration\nprocessors, photonic devices have been used to realize vector-\nmatrix multiplication (VMM). These processors are primarily\nimplemented by Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer (MZI) arrays\n[8\u201312] and parallel computing systems based on wavelength\ndivision multiplexer (WDM) technology [13\u201318]. However,\nMZI arrays are currently implemented mainly by coherent light,\nwhich has the defects of high impact of phase error accumula-\ntion, low scalability, and high impact by off-chip optical phase.\nCurrently, optical systems implemented based on WDM technol-\nogy mainly use micro-ring weight banks or crossbar structures\nof phase change materials to implement weight matrices. How-\never, the micro-ring array has phase sensitivity problems, which\ngreatly increases the difficulty of realization. The computational\nunit of phase change materials is not easily compatible with the\ntraditional complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)\nprocess. These systems can only realize the multiplication and\naddition of one vector and matrix at each operation, which has\nthe problem of insufficient arithmetic power. In the current mod-\nels, the major way to increase the arithmetic power is to increase\nthe scale of the computational chip, which has large hardware\nerrors such as additional packaging and electrical power con-\nsumption problems. Therefore, it is challenging to realize a\nhigher computational power integrated optical computing chip\n[14].\nAlthough the above-mentioned systems emphasize VMM\nacceleration, it is crucial to note that general matrix\u2013matrix mul-\ntiplication frequently predominates in deep learning computing\n[19,20]. Multiple input vectors must be combined into a single\nmatrix and multiplied simultaneously with a weight matrix to\nachieve optical matrix\u2013matrix multiplication. Therefore, VMM\nacceleration processors must operate sequentially or in parallel\n[19], which necessitates numerous computational cycles or mul-\ntiple parallel devices, but it has a large disadvantage in terms\nof computational efficiency or computational energy efficiency\nratio.\nObviously, the major way to improve the computational power\nand energy efficiency ratio of optical computing is by imple-\nmenting parallel computation of matrix\u2013matrix multiplication\nin a compact system.\nIn this paper, we propose a matrix\u2013matrix multiplication\nacceleration processor based on a WDM system and a non-\ncoherent MZI array. WDM devices are used to achieve the\ndimensional expansion of the input and output, which then\nenable matrix\u2013matrix multiplication to improve the paral-\nlel computational capability of the system. The non-coherent\nMZI array is implemented using dilated double-layer networks\n(DDLNs) [21], which can realize arbitrary nonnegative valued\nmatrices with low optical path loss and phase error accumu-\nlation. We implemented a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix multiplier of\n0146-9592/23/123231-04 Journal \u00a9 2023 Optica Publishing Group\n3232\nVol. 48, No. 12 / 15 June 2023 / Optics Letters\nLetter\nFig. 1.\nSchematic of photonic acceleration processor: (a) a\nphotonic neural network; (b) a photonic acceleration processor.\nnonnegative values using an 8 \u00d7 8 programmable MZI array as\nwell as four WDM devices. We experimentally verified that this\nstructure could achieve 90.5% inference accuracy in the clas-\nsification task of the Modified National Institute of Standards\nand Technology (MNIST) handwritten dataset in the PNN. This\nprovides an effective network for a large-scale integrated optical\ncomputing system based on matrix\u2013matrix convolution.\nFigure 1(a) is a schematic diagram of the photonic neural\nnetwork, which consists of an input layer, hidden layers, and\nan output layer. Optical signals are encoded by light intensity\nthrough a data arrangement unit in the WDM-based non-\ncoherent architecture. The proposed 2 \u00d7 2 topology network of\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication is shown in Fig. 1(b), which is\ncomposed of four MZIs and four WDMs. The input data [x1, x2,\nx3, x4, . . . , xn] with the different wavelengths [\u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3, \u03bb4, . . . ,\n\u03bbn] are simultaneously fed into the photonic hidden layer for the\nconvolution of matrices. The output result based on different\nwavelengths is represented as yi. The basic unit of the network\nis an MZI with an adjustable beam splitting ratio ai, bi, ci, di, i\n\u2208(0, 1, 2, . . . , N) in the interval from 0 to 1. Each MZI consists\nof two multimode interferometers (MMIs) with transmissivity\nfixed at 50:50 and two phase shifters, where one of the phase-\nshift arms uses thermal tuning to change the phase and thus the\nbeam-splitting ratio of the MZI unit. Since the MZI topology is\nsimilar to the DDLN, it perfectly inherits the advantage of low\noptical path loss in that structure [21]. Moreover, the number\nof MZI cascades in the middle of this structure is only two in\nany dimension, which further reduces the influence of phase\nerror accumulation on the calculation results in combination\nwith non-coherent light. A mapping function is formed between\nthe input and output:\n[\ufe03\ny11\ny12\ny21\ny22\n]\ufe03\n=\n[\ufe03\na1b1\nc1(1 \u2212b1)\n(1 \u2212a1)d1\n(1 \u2212c1)(1 \u2212d1)\n]\ufe03\n\u00d7\n[\ufe03\nx11\nx12\nx21\nx22\n]\ufe03\n.\n(1)\nThe input data x11 and x21 represent the input signal of wave-\nlength \u03bb1, and x12 and x22 represent the input signal of wavelength\n\u03bb2. The output data y11 and y21 are the y1 and y2 channel output\npower of wavelength \u03bb1, and y12 and y22 are the y1 and y2 chan-\nnel output power of wavelength \u03bb2, respectively. The parameters\na1, b1, c1, and d1 represent the beam-splitting ratio of the four\nadjustable MZIs in the network. The external voltage is loaded\nto the adjustable phase shift arm to alter phase when the optical\nsignal is input from the upper port of the MZI. The MZI unit\nis in the cross-state when the \u03c0 phase shift is reached, and we\ndefine the splitting ratio as 0. The MZI is in a bar-state and the\nsplitting ratio is defined as 1 when the phase difference between\nthe two phase shifters is 0. At this point, the upper port of the\nMZI output can deliver the maximum output. The MZI array\nusing this method can produce an arbitrary nonnegative valued\nmatrix. Although the splitting ratios of the MZI units within the\nstructure require matrix-based computation, it is adaptable for\nreal-time updates in on-chip training applications. Furthermore,\ncompared with traditional Mesh arrays [8], the proposed method\nreduces the computational load associated with singular value\ndecomposition calculations.\nWe used a programmable 8 \u00d7 8 thermo-optical, Benes-\nnetwork-based MZI array [22] and four WDMs to validate\nthe topology of the proposed 2 \u00d7 2 topology network of\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication. On the one hand, the channel\ncenter wavelengths of our selected commercial WDM devices\n(Flyin) are 1310 nm and 1330 nm, respectively. It has a 0.5-dB\nbandwidth of 13 nm. We chose the two wavelengths close car-\nrier wavelengths of 1316.5 nm and 1323.5 nm, which reduced\nthe requirement for wide bandwidth in the MZI wavelength char-\nacteristics. On the other hand, the schematic illustration of the\nstructure of a 2 \u00d7 2 nonnegative valued matrix using an 8 \u00d7 8\nBenes network is shown in Fig. 2(a). The input data were simul-\ntaneously encoded at two wavelengths and fed into the MZI\narray. It transmitted the data to the tunable MZI units through\nthe red dotted line-based path of the MZI. We adjusted the a1, b1,\nc1, and d1 to operate under an arbitrary matrix and thus receive\ninformation at the output for both wavelengths. The MZI array\nwas fabricated on top of a silicon-on-insulator wafer using the\nCMOS process at the Singapore Advanced Micro Foundry. It\nhas a 220-nm top silicon layer and a 3-\u00b5m buried oxide layer.\nThe ridge waveguide has a width of 500 nm and a height of\n130 nm, with a phase-shifter arm width of 2 \u00b5m and a length\nof 100 \u00b5m. The thermo-optic resistor has a width of 2 \u00b5m and a\nP\u03c0 of 19 mW. Figure 2(b) shows the microscopy image of the\nfabricated 8 \u00d7 8 MZI arrays for the proposed 2 \u00d7 2 nonnegative\nvalued matrix. The inset in Fig. 2(b) depicts a magnified image of\nthe MZI unit. Both phase shift arms are tunable, however, only\na single tunable phase shifter was loaded with voltage in the\nexperiment. We have pre-tested all the MZI states by a grating-\npower monitor in the array. Additionally, the signal should be\nFig. 2.\nSchematic of the fabricated device.

The inset is an enlarged illustration of the\nMZI unit.\nLetter\nVol. 48, No. 12 / 15 June 2023 / Optics Letters\n3233\nFig. 3.\nWavelength dependence transmission spectrum of the\nMZI unit with different bias voltages. The enlarged inset shows\nthe transmission spectrum between wavelengths 1316.5 nm and\n1323.5 nm.\ncalculated through a logical path to prevent it from being trans-\nmitted to the monitoring points, which can reduce power loss\nand calculation error.\nFigure 3 shows the transmission spectra of the cross port of\nthe MZI unit of the 8 \u00d7 8 MZI array at the wavelength range of\n1280 nm to 1360 nm, for bias voltages of 0 V, 1 V, 1.6 V, 2 V,\n2.5 V, and 3 V. The insertion loss of the MZI unit at 1310 nm\nis approximately \u22123.2 dB. As the voltage increases, the port\u2019s\noutput power decreases, and the trend is consistent with the ini-\ntial state. The enlarged image in Fig. 3 shows the difference of\n0.49 dB in the transmission power of the MZI unit at 1316.5 nm\nand 1323.5 nm. We can compensate for the error using the input\npower. Therefore, in the range of this wavelength, we can default\nthe response of the tunable MZI unit to be the same for different\nwavelengths of signals loaded with different bias voltages. It\ncan be inferred that the light intensity after the transmission is\nthe same for the whole MZI array for different wavelengths of\noptical signals, ensuring that signals of various wavelengths can\nbe multiplied by the same matrix. The fluctuations in the trans-\nmission spectrum may be attributed to reflections and scattering\noccurring at the interfaces of waveguide structures or grating\ncouplers, as well as to environmental factors.\nThe experimental setup for the system validation is shown\nin Fig. 4. We demonstrated the computation of multiplication\nand addition of 2 \u00d7 2 matrices based on the MNIST handwrit-\nten digits dataset. The result of this computation is the first\nconvolutional layer in the PNN model for the task of handwrit-\nten digit recognition and classification. For each image in the\ndataset, there were 28 \u00d7 28 gray scale pixel values to be calcu-\nlated. These values were normalized and encoded as coefficients\nof one-dimensional radio frequency (RF) signals in a specific\norder. The RF signals output from an arbitrary waveform gen-\nerator (AWG, Keysight M8194A) were amplified by microwave\namplifiers (SHF 804B) and were loaded onto commercial mod-\nulators (iXblue MX1300-LN-40). By using DC voltage, the\nmodulators were set to operate at a 3-dB operating point. A\nmaximum calculation rate of 40 GMAC/s was possible thanks\nto the AWG\u2019s sampling rate of 100 GSa/s and the input data\u2019s\nsampling rate of 20 samples per symbol (sps).

The optical signal containing the input-data informa-\ntion was obtained from the modulator and fed to two independent\nWDMs. The output optical signals of the WDMs were verti-\ncally coupled to the chip using a fiber array. The on-chip loss at\n1310 nm is approximately \u221216.2 dB. Finally, the optical signals\ncarrying the calculation results were demultiplexed by WDMs,\nand the optical signals of different wavelengths were fed into\na praseodymium-doped fiber amplifier (AMP-FL8611-OB-20)\nfor amplification. A balanced photoelectric detector (Finisar\nBPDV2120R) then turned these into electrical signals, which\nwere then detected by a real-time oscilloscope (UXR0594A,\n256 GSa/s, 59 GHz bandwidth). Using a computer, the collected\nwaveforms were time-synchronized, down-sampled to 1 sps, and\nthen transferred to the PNN\u2019s next layer.\nFigure 5(a) illustrates the architecture of the PNN of our chip\nfor image recognition tasks. It consists of an input layer, two\nconvolution layers, two fully connected layers, and an output\nlayer. The optical matrix multiplication and addition opera-\ntions are the first convolution layer. The 28 \u00d7 28 gray scale\nimages were encoded as 784 \u00d7 20 vectors and fed into the opti-\ncal matrix\u2013matrix multiplier in four groups sequentially. The\ncalculation\u2019s output was transferred to the hidden layer below\nafter being down-sampled to a value of 784 \u00d7 1. The output\nlayer divided the data into 10 groups that correspond to the\nintegers 0 to 9. The simulation model was built in PyTorch\n[23] and trained by a stochastic gradient descent optimizer with\na learning rate of 0.005. The activation function used in the\nPNN model was rectified linear unit [24]. The real-time com-\nputational results of the y11 port are shown in Fig. 5(b) when\nthe computational data of the x11 channel are supplied. The red\nsolid curve is the result obtained from the simulation and the\nblue dashed curve is the experimentally obtained time trajectory.\nWithin 20 ns continually, the computed data essentially match\nthe simulated data, indicating great computation accuracy for a\ncomputing rate of 40 GMAC/s. A 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix convolu-\ntion calculation implemented in an optical system was used to\nbuild a PNN to classify handwritten digits in the dataset MNIST.\nThe dataset was divided into a training set and a test set. Our\nmodel had been trained on the whole training set, and 200 sam-\nples from the test set were used to check the precision of the\nresults computed on the chip.

The accuracy is not only influenced by errors\nin input encoding, output data extraction, and device insertion\nloss during testing, but also closely related to factors such as\nthe PNN network structure and training parameters. In future\nresearch, accuracy can be further improved by optimizing these\naspects.\nIn conclusion, we have presented a novel, to the best of\nour knowledge, 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix multiplication acceleration\nprocessor that uses a WDM system and a non-coherent MZI\narray. The WDM devices enable the extension of the input and\noutput dimensions, and the wide bandwidth of MZI devices\nallows different wavelengths to function properly within the\noptical computing chip. This enables matrix\u2013matrix multiplica-\ntion and addition operations, thereby enhancing the parallelism\nand computational power of optical computing. In our sys-\ntem, a nonnegative weight matrix is cleverly implemented\nusing a dilated double-layer-based MZI array, inheriting the\nadvantages of this structure in terms of optical path loss.\nWe have experimentally demonstrated the feasibility of this\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication acceleration processor by using\nit to perform image recognition on handwritten digits from\nthe MNIST dataset and have achieved an inference accuracy\nof 90.5% with a computing rate of 40 GMAC/s. Consid-\nering the encoding of digital-to-analog converters and the\nsampling of analog-to-digital converters, their time overhead\ndoes not increase with the matrix scale N. Nevertheless, the\ncomputational capacity of the proposed structure grows propor-\ntionally to N2, thereby emphasizing its advantages in large-scale\narrays.

The dimensional expansion\nis achieved by WDM devices, which play a crucial role in\nrealizing matrix\u2013matrix multiplication together with the\nbroadband characteristics of an MZI. We implemented a\n2 \u00d7 2 arbitrary nonnegative valued matrix using a reconfig-\nurable 8 \u00d7 8 MZI array structure. Through experimentation,\nwe verified that this structure could achieve 90.5% infer-\nence accuracy in a classification task for the Modified\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST)\nhandwritten dataset. This provides a new effective solution\nfor large-scale integrated optical computing systems based\non convolution acceleration processors.\n\u00a9 2023 Optica Pub-\nlishing Group\nhttps://doi.org/10.1364/OL.488464\nThe requirement for computing power is rising in tandem with\nthe expansion of artificial intelligence applications [1,2]. Elec-\ntronic devices are unable to meet the aforementioned standards\nbecause they are limited by the speed of traditional microelec-\ntronic processors. The photon has become a new topic of study as\nan information carrier [3\u20135]. Matrix multiplications and addition\ncalculations are performed by photonic acceleration processors\nutilizing photonic devices [6,7], which can further be combined\nwith electrical devices to build photonic neural networks (PNNs)\nfor artificial intelligence applications. As a result, it is anticipated\nthat a photonic acceleration processor will operate quicker and\nmore efficiently than its electrical counterpart.\nIn the majority of the recent research on photonic acceleration\nprocessors, photonic devices have been used to realize vector-\nmatrix multiplication (VMM). These processors are primarily\nimplemented by Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer (MZI) arrays\n[8\u201312] and parallel computing systems based on wavelength\ndivision multiplexer (WDM) technology [13\u201318]. However,\nMZI arrays are currently implemented mainly by coherent light,\nwhich has the defects of high impact of phase error accumula-\ntion, low scalability, and high impact by off-chip optical phase.\nCurrently, optical systems implemented based on WDM technol-\nogy mainly use micro-ring weight banks or crossbar structures\nof phase change materials to implement weight matrices. How-\never, the micro-ring array has phase sensitivity problems, which\ngreatly increases the difficulty of realization. The computational\nunit of phase change materials is not easily compatible with the\ntraditional complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)\nprocess. These systems can only realize the multiplication and\naddition of one vector and matrix at each operation, which has\nthe problem of insufficient arithmetic power. In the current mod-\nels, the major way to increase the arithmetic power is to increase\nthe scale of the computational chip, which has large hardware\nerrors such as additional packaging and electrical power con-\nsumption problems. Therefore, it is challenging to realize a\nhigher computational power integrated optical computing chip\n[14].\nAlthough the above-mentioned systems emphasize VMM\nacceleration, it is crucial to note that general matrix\u2013matrix mul-\ntiplication frequently predominates in deep learning computing\n[19,20]. Multiple input vectors must be combined into a single\nmatrix and multiplied simultaneously with a weight matrix to\nachieve optical matrix\u2013matrix multiplication. Therefore, VMM\nacceleration processors must operate sequentially or in parallel\n[19], which necessitates numerous computational cycles or mul-\ntiple parallel devices, but it has a large disadvantage in terms\nof computational efficiency or computational energy efficiency\nratio.\nObviously, the major way to improve the computational power\nand energy efficiency ratio of optical computing is by imple-\nmenting parallel computation of matrix\u2013matrix multiplication\nin a compact system.\nIn this paper, we propose a matrix\u2013matrix multiplication\nacceleration processor based on a WDM system and a non-\ncoherent MZI array. WDM devices are used to achieve the\ndimensional expansion of the input and output, which then\nenable matrix\u2013matrix multiplication to improve the paral-\nlel computational capability of the system. The non-coherent\nMZI array is implemented using dilated double-layer networks\n(DDLNs) [21], which can realize arbitrary nonnegative valued\nmatrices with low optical path loss and phase error accumu-\nlation. We implemented a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix multiplier of\n0146-9592/23/123231-04 Journal \u00a9 2023 Optica Publishing Group\n3232\nVol. 48, No. 12 / 15 June 2023 / Optics Letters\nLetter\nFig. 1.\nSchematic of photonic acceleration processor: (a) a\nphotonic neural network; (b) a photonic acceleration processor.\nnonnegative values using an 8 \u00d7 8 programmable MZI array as\nwell as four WDM devices. We experimentally verified that this\nstructure could achieve 90.5% inference accuracy in the clas-\nsification task of the Modified National Institute of Standards\nand Technology (MNIST) handwritten dataset in the PNN. This\nprovides an effective network for a large-scale integrated optical\ncomputing system based on matrix\u2013matrix convolution.\nFigure 1(a) is a schematic diagram of the photonic neural\nnetwork, which consists of an input layer, hidden layers, and\nan output layer. Optical signals are encoded by light intensity\nthrough a data arrangement unit in the WDM-based non-\ncoherent architecture. The proposed 2 \u00d7 2 topology network of\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication is shown in Fig. 1(b), which is\ncomposed of four MZIs and four WDMs. The input data [x1, x2,\nx3, x4, . . . , xn] with the different wavelengths [\u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3, \u03bb4, . . . ,\n\u03bbn] are simultaneously fed into the photonic hidden layer for the\nconvolution of matrices. The output result based on different\nwavelengths is represented as yi. The basic unit of the network\nis an MZI with an adjustable beam splitting ratio ai, bi, ci, di, i\n\u2208(0, 1, 2, . . . , N) in the interval from 0 to 1. Each MZI consists\nof two multimode interferometers (MMIs) with transmissivity\nfixed at 50:50 and two phase shifters, where one of the phase-\nshift arms uses thermal tuning to change the phase and thus the\nbeam-splitting ratio of the MZI unit. Since the MZI topology is\nsimilar to the DDLN, it perfectly inherits the advantage of low\noptical path loss in that structure [21]. Moreover, the number\nof MZI cascades in the middle of this structure is only two in\nany dimension, which further reduces the influence of phase\nerror accumulation on the calculation results in combination\nwith non-coherent light. A mapping function is formed between\nthe input and output:\n[\ufe03\ny11\ny12\ny21\ny22\n]\ufe03\n=\n[\ufe03\na1b1\nc1(1 \u2212b1)\n(1 \u2212a1)d1\n(1 \u2212c1)(1 \u2212d1)\n]\ufe03\n\u00d7\n[\ufe03\nx11\nx12\nx21\nx22\n]\ufe03\n.\n(1)\nThe input data x11 and x21 represent the input signal of wave-\nlength \u03bb1, and x12 and x22 represent the input signal of wavelength\n\u03bb2. The output data y11 and y21 are the y1 and y2 channel output\npower of wavelength \u03bb1, and y12 and y22 are the y1 and y2 chan-\nnel output power of wavelength \u03bb2, respectively. The parameters\na1, b1, c1, and d1 represent the beam-splitting ratio of the four\nadjustable MZIs in the network. The external voltage is loaded\nto the adjustable phase shift arm to alter phase when the optical\nsignal is input from the upper port of the MZI. The MZI unit\nis in the cross-state when the \u03c0 phase shift is reached, and we\ndefine the splitting ratio as 0. The MZI is in a bar-state and the\nsplitting ratio is defined as 1 when the phase difference between\nthe two phase shifters is 0. At this point, the upper port of the\nMZI output can deliver the maximum output. The MZI array\nusing this method can produce an arbitrary nonnegative valued\nmatrix. Although the splitting ratios of the MZI units within the\nstructure require matrix-based computation, it is adaptable for\nreal-time updates in on-chip training applications. Furthermore,\ncompared with traditional Mesh arrays [8], the proposed method\nreduces the computational load associated with singular value\ndecomposition calculations.\nWe used a programmable 8 \u00d7 8 thermo-optical, Benes-\nnetwork-based MZI array [22] and four WDMs to validate\nthe topology of the proposed 2 \u00d7 2 topology network of\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication. On the one hand, the channel\ncenter wavelengths of our selected commercial WDM devices\n(Flyin) are 1310 nm and 1330 nm, respectively. It has a 0.5-dB\nbandwidth of 13 nm. We chose the two wavelengths close car-\nrier wavelengths of 1316.5 nm and 1323.5 nm, which reduced\nthe requirement for wide bandwidth in the MZI wavelength char-\nacteristics. On the other hand, the schematic illustration of the\nstructure of a 2 \u00d7 2 nonnegative valued matrix using an 8 \u00d7 8\nBenes network is shown in Fig. 2(a). The input data were simul-\ntaneously encoded at two wavelengths and fed into the MZI\narray. It transmitted the data to the tunable MZI units through\nthe red dotted line-based path of the MZI. We adjusted the a1, b1,\nc1, and d1 to operate under an arbitrary matrix and thus receive\ninformation at the output for both wavelengths. The MZI array\nwas fabricated on top of a silicon-on-insulator wafer using the\nCMOS process at the Singapore Advanced Micro Foundry. It\nhas a 220-nm top silicon layer and a 3-\u00b5m buried oxide layer.\nThe ridge waveguide has a width of 500 nm and a height of\n130 nm, with a phase-shifter arm width of 2 \u00b5m and a length\nof 100 \u00b5m. The thermo-optic resistor has a width of 2 \u00b5m and a\nP\u03c0 of 19 mW. Figure 2(b) shows the microscopy image of the\nfabricated 8 \u00d7 8 MZI arrays for the proposed 2 \u00d7 2 nonnegative\nvalued matrix. The inset in Fig. 2(b) depicts a magnified image of\nthe MZI unit. Both phase shift arms are tunable, however, only\na single tunable phase shifter was loaded with voltage in the\nexperiment. We have pre-tested all the MZI states by a grating-\npower monitor in the array. Additionally, the signal should be\nFig. 2.\nSchematic of the fabricated device.

The inset is an enlarged illustration of the\nMZI unit.\nLetter\nVol. 48, No. 12 / 15 June 2023 / Optics Letters\n3233\nFig. 3.\nWavelength dependence transmission spectrum of the\nMZI unit with different bias voltages. The enlarged inset shows\nthe transmission spectrum between wavelengths 1316.5 nm and\n1323.5 nm.\ncalculated through a logical path to prevent it from being trans-\nmitted to the monitoring points, which can reduce power loss\nand calculation error.\nFigure 3 shows the transmission spectra of the cross port of\nthe MZI unit of the 8 \u00d7 8 MZI array at the wavelength range of\n1280 nm to 1360 nm, for bias voltages of 0 V, 1 V, 1.6 V, 2 V,\n2.5 V, and 3 V. The insertion loss of the MZI unit at 1310 nm\nis approximately \u22123.2 dB. As the voltage increases, the port\u2019s\noutput power decreases, and the trend is consistent with the ini-\ntial state. The enlarged image in Fig. 3 shows the difference of\n0.49 dB in the transmission power of the MZI unit at 1316.5 nm\nand 1323.5 nm. We can compensate for the error using the input\npower. Therefore, in the range of this wavelength, we can default\nthe response of the tunable MZI unit to be the same for different\nwavelengths of signals loaded with different bias voltages. It\ncan be inferred that the light intensity after the transmission is\nthe same for the whole MZI array for different wavelengths of\noptical signals, ensuring that signals of various wavelengths can\nbe multiplied by the same matrix. The fluctuations in the trans-\nmission spectrum may be attributed to reflections and scattering\noccurring at the interfaces of waveguide structures or grating\ncouplers, as well as to environmental factors.\nThe experimental setup for the system validation is shown\nin Fig. 4. We demonstrated the computation of multiplication\nand addition of 2 \u00d7 2 matrices based on the MNIST handwrit-\nten digits dataset. The result of this computation is the first\nconvolutional layer in the PNN model for the task of handwrit-\nten digit recognition and classification. For each image in the\ndataset, there were 28 \u00d7 28 gray scale pixel values to be calcu-\nlated. These values were normalized and encoded as coefficients\nof one-dimensional radio frequency (RF) signals in a specific\norder. The RF signals output from an arbitrary waveform gen-\nerator (AWG, Keysight M8194A) were amplified by microwave\namplifiers (SHF 804B) and were loaded onto commercial mod-\nulators (iXblue MX1300-LN-40). By using DC voltage, the\nmodulators were set to operate at a 3-dB operating point. A\nmaximum calculation rate of 40 GMAC/s was possible thanks\nto the AWG\u2019s sampling rate of 100 GSa/s and the input data\u2019s\nsampling rate of 20 samples per symbol (sps).

The optical signal containing the input-data informa-\ntion was obtained from the modulator and fed to two independent\nWDMs. The output optical signals of the WDMs were verti-\ncally coupled to the chip using a fiber array. The on-chip loss at\n1310 nm is approximately \u221216.2 dB. Finally, the optical signals\ncarrying the calculation results were demultiplexed by WDMs,\nand the optical signals of different wavelengths were fed into\na praseodymium-doped fiber amplifier (AMP-FL8611-OB-20)\nfor amplification. A balanced photoelectric detector (Finisar\nBPDV2120R) then turned these into electrical signals, which\nwere then detected by a real-time oscilloscope (UXR0594A,\n256 GSa/s, 59 GHz bandwidth). Using a computer, the collected\nwaveforms were time-synchronized, down-sampled to 1 sps, and\nthen transferred to the PNN\u2019s next layer.\nFigure 5(a) illustrates the architecture of the PNN of our chip\nfor image recognition tasks. It consists of an input layer, two\nconvolution layers, two fully connected layers, and an output\nlayer. The optical matrix multiplication and addition opera-\ntions are the first convolution layer. The 28 \u00d7 28 gray scale\nimages were encoded as 784 \u00d7 20 vectors and fed into the opti-\ncal matrix\u2013matrix multiplier in four groups sequentially. The\ncalculation\u2019s output was transferred to the hidden layer below\nafter being down-sampled to a value of 784 \u00d7 1. The output\nlayer divided the data into 10 groups that correspond to the\nintegers 0 to 9. The simulation model was built in PyTorch\n[23] and trained by a stochastic gradient descent optimizer with\na learning rate of 0.005. The activation function used in the\nPNN model was rectified linear unit [24]. The real-time com-\nputational results of the y11 port are shown in Fig. 5(b) when\nthe computational data of the x11 channel are supplied. The red\nsolid curve is the result obtained from the simulation and the\nblue dashed curve is the experimentally obtained time trajectory.\nWithin 20 ns continually, the computed data essentially match\nthe simulated data, indicating great computation accuracy for a\ncomputing rate of 40 GMAC/s. A 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix convolu-\ntion calculation implemented in an optical system was used to\nbuild a PNN to classify handwritten digits in the dataset MNIST.\nThe dataset was divided into a training set and a test set. Our\nmodel had been trained on the whole training set, and 200 sam-\nples from the test set were used to check the precision of the\nresults computed on the chip.

The accuracy is not only influenced by errors\nin input encoding, output data extraction, and device insertion\nloss during testing, but also closely related to factors such as\nthe PNN network structure and training parameters. In future\nresearch, accuracy can be further improved by optimizing these\naspects.\nIn conclusion, we have presented a novel, to the best of\nour knowledge, 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix multiplication acceleration\nprocessor that uses a WDM system and a non-coherent MZI\narray. The WDM devices enable the extension of the input and\noutput dimensions, and the wide bandwidth of MZI devices\nallows different wavelengths to function properly within the\noptical computing chip. This enables matrix\u2013matrix multiplica-\ntion and addition operations, thereby enhancing the parallelism\nand computational power of optical computing. In our sys-\ntem, a nonnegative weight matrix is cleverly implemented\nusing a dilated double-layer-based MZI array, inheriting the\nadvantages of this structure in terms of optical path loss.\nWe have experimentally demonstrated the feasibility of this\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication acceleration processor by using\nit to perform image recognition on handwritten digits from\nthe MNIST dataset and have achieved an inference accuracy\nof 90.5% with a computing rate of 40 GMAC/s. Consid-\nering the encoding of digital-to-analog converters and the\nsampling of analog-to-digital converters, their time overhead\ndoes not increase with the matrix scale N. Nevertheless, the\ncomputational capacity of the proposed structure grows propor-\ntionally to N2, thereby emphasizing its advantages in large-scale\narrays.

The dimensional expansion\nis achieved by WDM devices, which play a crucial role in\nrealizing matrix\u2013matrix multiplication together with the\nbroadband characteristics of an MZI. We implemented a\n2 \u00d7 2 arbitrary nonnegative valued matrix using a reconfig-\nurable 8 \u00d7 8 MZI array structure. Through experimentation,\nwe verified that this structure could achieve 90.5% infer-\nence accuracy in a classification task for the Modified\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST)\nhandwritten dataset. This provides a new effective solution\nfor large-scale integrated optical computing systems based\non convolution acceleration processors.\n\u00a9 2023 Optica Pub-\nlishing Group\nhttps://doi.org/10.1364/OL.488464\nThe requirement for computing power is rising in tandem with\nthe expansion of artificial intelligence applications [1,2]. Elec-\ntronic devices are unable to meet the aforementioned standards\nbecause they are limited by the speed of traditional microelec-\ntronic processors. The photon has become a new topic of study as\nan information carrier [3\u20135]. Matrix multiplications and addition\ncalculations are performed by photonic acceleration processors\nutilizing photonic devices [6,7], which can further be combined\nwith electrical devices to build photonic neural networks (PNNs)\nfor artificial intelligence applications. As a result, it is anticipated\nthat a photonic acceleration processor will operate quicker and\nmore efficiently than its electrical counterpart.\nIn the majority of the recent research on photonic acceleration\nprocessors, photonic devices have been used to realize vector-\nmatrix multiplication (VMM). These processors are primarily\nimplemented by Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer (MZI) arrays\n[8\u201312] and parallel computing systems based on wavelength\ndivision multiplexer (WDM) technology [13\u201318]. However,\nMZI arrays are currently implemented mainly by coherent light,\nwhich has the defects of high impact of phase error accumula-\ntion, low scalability, and high impact by off-chip optical phase.\nCurrently, optical systems implemented based on WDM technol-\nogy mainly use micro-ring weight banks or crossbar structures\nof phase change materials to implement weight matrices. How-\never, the micro-ring array has phase sensitivity problems, which\ngreatly increases the difficulty of realization. The computational\nunit of phase change materials is not easily compatible with the\ntraditional complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)\nprocess. These systems can only realize the multiplication and\naddition of one vector and matrix at each operation, which has\nthe problem of insufficient arithmetic power. In the current mod-\nels, the major way to increase the arithmetic power is to increase\nthe scale of the computational chip, which has large hardware\nerrors such as additional packaging and electrical power con-\nsumption problems. Therefore, it is challenging to realize a\nhigher computational power integrated optical computing chip\n[14].\nAlthough the above-mentioned systems emphasize VMM\nacceleration, it is crucial to note that general matrix\u2013matrix mul-\ntiplication frequently predominates in deep learning computing\n[19,20]. Multiple input vectors must be combined into a single\nmatrix and multiplied simultaneously with a weight matrix to\nachieve optical matrix\u2013matrix multiplication. Therefore, VMM\nacceleration processors must operate sequentially or in parallel\n[19], which necessitates numerous computational cycles or mul-\ntiple parallel devices, but it has a large disadvantage in terms\nof computational efficiency or computational energy efficiency\nratio.\nObviously, the major way to improve the computational power\nand energy efficiency ratio of optical computing is by imple-\nmenting parallel computation of matrix\u2013matrix multiplication\nin a compact system.\nIn this paper, we propose a matrix\u2013matrix multiplication\nacceleration processor based on a WDM system and a non-\ncoherent MZI array. WDM devices are used to achieve the\ndimensional expansion of the input and output, which then\nenable matrix\u2013matrix multiplication to improve the paral-\nlel computational capability of the system. The non-coherent\nMZI array is implemented using dilated double-layer networks\n(DDLNs) [21], which can realize arbitrary nonnegative valued\nmatrices with low optical path loss and phase error accumu-\nlation. We implemented a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix multiplier of\n0146-9592/23/123231-04 Journal \u00a9 2023 Optica Publishing Group\n3232\nVol. 48, No. 12 / 15 June 2023 / Optics Letters\nLetter\nFig. 1.\nSchematic of photonic acceleration processor: (a) a\nphotonic neural network; (b) a photonic acceleration processor.\nnonnegative values using an 8 \u00d7 8 programmable MZI array as\nwell as four WDM devices. We experimentally verified that this\nstructure could achieve 90.5% inference accuracy in the clas-\nsification task of the Modified National Institute of Standards\nand Technology (MNIST) handwritten dataset in the PNN. This\nprovides an effective network for a large-scale integrated optical\ncomputing system based on matrix\u2013matrix convolution.\nFigure 1(a) is a schematic diagram of the photonic neural\nnetwork, which consists of an input layer, hidden layers, and\nan output layer. Optical signals are encoded by light intensity\nthrough a data arrangement unit in the WDM-based non-\ncoherent architecture. The proposed 2 \u00d7 2 topology network of\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication is shown in Fig. 1(b), which is\ncomposed of four MZIs and four WDMs. The input data [x1, x2,\nx3, x4, . . . , xn] with the different wavelengths [\u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3, \u03bb4, . . . ,\n\u03bbn] are simultaneously fed into the photonic hidden layer for the\nconvolution of matrices. The output result based on different\nwavelengths is represented as yi. The basic unit of the network\nis an MZI with an adjustable beam splitting ratio ai, bi, ci, di, i\n\u2208(0, 1, 2, . . . , N) in the interval from 0 to 1. Each MZI consists\nof two multimode interferometers (MMIs) with transmissivity\nfixed at 50:50 and two phase shifters, where one of the phase-\nshift arms uses thermal tuning to change the phase and thus the\nbeam-splitting ratio of the MZI unit. Since the MZI topology is\nsimilar to the DDLN, it perfectly inherits the advantage of low\noptical path loss in that structure [21]. Moreover, the number\nof MZI cascades in the middle of this structure is only two in\nany dimension, which further reduces the influence of phase\nerror accumulation on the calculation results in combination\nwith non-coherent light. A mapping function is formed between\nthe input and output:\n[\ufe03\ny11\ny12\ny21\ny22\n]\ufe03\n=\n[\ufe03\na1b1\nc1(1 \u2212b1)\n(1 \u2212a1)d1\n(1 \u2212c1)(1 \u2212d1)\n]\ufe03\n\u00d7\n[\ufe03\nx11\nx12\nx21\nx22\n]\ufe03\n.\n(1)\nThe input data x11 and x21 represent the input signal of wave-\nlength \u03bb1, and x12 and x22 represent the input signal of wavelength\n\u03bb2. The output data y11 and y21 are the y1 and y2 channel output\npower of wavelength \u03bb1, and y12 and y22 are the y1 and y2 chan-\nnel output power of wavelength \u03bb2, respectively. The parameters\na1, b1, c1, and d1 represent the beam-splitting ratio of the four\nadjustable MZIs in the network. The external voltage is loaded\nto the adjustable phase shift arm to alter phase when the optical\nsignal is input from the upper port of the MZI. The MZI unit\nis in the cross-state when the \u03c0 phase shift is reached, and we\ndefine the splitting ratio as 0. The MZI is in a bar-state and the\nsplitting ratio is defined as 1 when the phase difference between\nthe two phase shifters is 0. At this point, the upper port of the\nMZI output can deliver the maximum output. The MZI array\nusing this method can produce an arbitrary nonnegative valued\nmatrix. Although the splitting ratios of the MZI units within the\nstructure require matrix-based computation, it is adaptable for\nreal-time updates in on-chip training applications. Furthermore,\ncompared with traditional Mesh arrays [8], the proposed method\nreduces the computational load associated with singular value\ndecomposition calculations.\nWe used a programmable 8 \u00d7 8 thermo-optical, Benes-\nnetwork-based MZI array [22] and four WDMs to validate\nthe topology of the proposed 2 \u00d7 2 topology network of\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication. On the one hand, the channel\ncenter wavelengths of our selected commercial WDM devices\n(Flyin) are 1310 nm and 1330 nm, respectively. It has a 0.5-dB\nbandwidth of 13 nm. We chose the two wavelengths close car-\nrier wavelengths of 1316.5 nm and 1323.5 nm, which reduced\nthe requirement for wide bandwidth in the MZI wavelength char-\nacteristics. On the other hand, the schematic illustration of the\nstructure of a 2 \u00d7 2 nonnegative valued matrix using an 8 \u00d7 8\nBenes network is shown in Fig. 2(a). The input data were simul-\ntaneously encoded at two wavelengths and fed into the MZI\narray. It transmitted the data to the tunable MZI units through\nthe red dotted line-based path of the MZI. We adjusted the a1, b1,\nc1, and d1 to operate under an arbitrary matrix and thus receive\ninformation at the output for both wavelengths. The MZI array\nwas fabricated on top of a silicon-on-insulator wafer using the\nCMOS process at the Singapore Advanced Micro Foundry. It\nhas a 220-nm top silicon layer and a 3-\u00b5m buried oxide layer.\nThe ridge waveguide has a width of 500 nm and a height of\n130 nm, with a phase-shifter arm width of 2 \u00b5m and a length\nof 100 \u00b5m. The thermo-optic resistor has a width of 2 \u00b5m and a\nP\u03c0 of 19 mW. Figure 2(b) shows the microscopy image of the\nfabricated 8 \u00d7 8 MZI arrays for the proposed 2 \u00d7 2 nonnegative\nvalued matrix. The inset in Fig. 2(b) depicts a magnified image of\nthe MZI unit. Both phase shift arms are tunable, however, only\na single tunable phase shifter was loaded with voltage in the\nexperiment. We have pre-tested all the MZI states by a grating-\npower monitor in the array. Additionally, the signal should be\nFig. 2.\nSchematic of the fabricated device.

The inset is an enlarged illustration of the\nMZI unit.\nLetter\nVol. 48, No. 12 / 15 June 2023 / Optics Letters\n3233\nFig. 3.\nWavelength dependence transmission spectrum of the\nMZI unit with different bias voltages. The enlarged inset shows\nthe transmission spectrum between wavelengths 1316.5 nm and\n1323.5 nm.\ncalculated through a logical path to prevent it from being trans-\nmitted to the monitoring points, which can reduce power loss\nand calculation error.\nFigure 3 shows the transmission spectra of the cross port of\nthe MZI unit of the 8 \u00d7 8 MZI array at the wavelength range of\n1280 nm to 1360 nm, for bias voltages of 0 V, 1 V, 1.6 V, 2 V,\n2.5 V, and 3 V. The insertion loss of the MZI unit at 1310 nm\nis approximately \u22123.2 dB. As the voltage increases, the port\u2019s\noutput power decreases, and the trend is consistent with the ini-\ntial state. The enlarged image in Fig. 3 shows the difference of\n0.49 dB in the transmission power of the MZI unit at 1316.5 nm\nand 1323.5 nm. We can compensate for the error using the input\npower. Therefore, in the range of this wavelength, we can default\nthe response of the tunable MZI unit to be the same for different\nwavelengths of signals loaded with different bias voltages. It\ncan be inferred that the light intensity after the transmission is\nthe same for the whole MZI array for different wavelengths of\noptical signals, ensuring that signals of various wavelengths can\nbe multiplied by the same matrix. The fluctuations in the trans-\nmission spectrum may be attributed to reflections and scattering\noccurring at the interfaces of waveguide structures or grating\ncouplers, as well as to environmental factors.\nThe experimental setup for the system validation is shown\nin Fig. 4. We demonstrated the computation of multiplication\nand addition of 2 \u00d7 2 matrices based on the MNIST handwrit-\nten digits dataset. The result of this computation is the first\nconvolutional layer in the PNN model for the task of handwrit-\nten digit recognition and classification. For each image in the\ndataset, there were 28 \u00d7 28 gray scale pixel values to be calcu-\nlated. These values were normalized and encoded as coefficients\nof one-dimensional radio frequency (RF) signals in a specific\norder. The RF signals output from an arbitrary waveform gen-\nerator (AWG, Keysight M8194A) were amplified by microwave\namplifiers (SHF 804B) and were loaded onto commercial mod-\nulators (iXblue MX1300-LN-40). By using DC voltage, the\nmodulators were set to operate at a 3-dB operating point. A\nmaximum calculation rate of 40 GMAC/s was possible thanks\nto the AWG\u2019s sampling rate of 100 GSa/s and the input data\u2019s\nsampling rate of 20 samples per symbol (sps).

The optical signal containing the input-data informa-\ntion was obtained from the modulator and fed to two independent\nWDMs. The output optical signals of the WDMs were verti-\ncally coupled to the chip using a fiber array. The on-chip loss at\n1310 nm is approximately \u221216.2 dB. Finally, the optical signals\ncarrying the calculation results were demultiplexed by WDMs,\nand the optical signals of different wavelengths were fed into\na praseodymium-doped fiber amplifier (AMP-FL8611-OB-20)\nfor amplification. A balanced photoelectric detector (Finisar\nBPDV2120R) then turned these into electrical signals, which\nwere then detected by a real-time oscilloscope (UXR0594A,\n256 GSa/s, 59 GHz bandwidth). Using a computer, the collected\nwaveforms were time-synchronized, down-sampled to 1 sps, and\nthen transferred to the PNN\u2019s next layer.\nFigure 5(a) illustrates the architecture of the PNN of our chip\nfor image recognition tasks. It consists of an input layer, two\nconvolution layers, two fully connected layers, and an output\nlayer. The optical matrix multiplication and addition opera-\ntions are the first convolution layer. The 28 \u00d7 28 gray scale\nimages were encoded as 784 \u00d7 20 vectors and fed into the opti-\ncal matrix\u2013matrix multiplier in four groups sequentially. The\ncalculation\u2019s output was transferred to the hidden layer below\nafter being down-sampled to a value of 784 \u00d7 1. The output\nlayer divided the data into 10 groups that correspond to the\nintegers 0 to 9. The simulation model was built in PyTorch\n[23] and trained by a stochastic gradient descent optimizer with\na learning rate of 0.005. The activation function used in the\nPNN model was rectified linear unit [24]. The real-time com-\nputational results of the y11 port are shown in Fig. 5(b) when\nthe computational data of the x11 channel are supplied. The red\nsolid curve is the result obtained from the simulation and the\nblue dashed curve is the experimentally obtained time trajectory.\nWithin 20 ns continually, the computed data essentially match\nthe simulated data, indicating great computation accuracy for a\ncomputing rate of 40 GMAC/s. A 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix convolu-\ntion calculation implemented in an optical system was used to\nbuild a PNN to classify handwritten digits in the dataset MNIST.\nThe dataset was divided into a training set and a test set. Our\nmodel had been trained on the whole training set, and 200 sam-\nples from the test set were used to check the precision of the\nresults computed on the chip.

The accuracy is not only influenced by errors\nin input encoding, output data extraction, and device insertion\nloss during testing, but also closely related to factors such as\nthe PNN network structure and training parameters. In future\nresearch, accuracy can be further improved by optimizing these\naspects.\nIn conclusion, we have presented a novel, to the best of\nour knowledge, 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\u2013matrix multiplication acceleration\nprocessor that uses a WDM system and a non-coherent MZI\narray. The WDM devices enable the extension of the input and\noutput dimensions, and the wide bandwidth of MZI devices\nallows different wavelengths to function properly within the\noptical computing chip. This enables matrix\u2013matrix multiplica-\ntion and addition operations, thereby enhancing the parallelism\nand computational power of optical computing. In our sys-\ntem, a nonnegative weight matrix is cleverly implemented\nusing a dilated double-layer-based MZI array, inheriting the\nadvantages of this structure in terms of optical path loss.\nWe have experimentally demonstrated the feasibility of this\nmatrix\u2013matrix multiplication acceleration processor by using\nit to perform image recognition on handwritten digits from\nthe MNIST dataset and have achieved an inference accuracy\nof 90.5% with a computing rate of 40 GMAC/s. Consid-\nering the encoding of digital-to-analog converters and the\nsampling of analog-to-digital converters, their time overhead\ndoes not increase with the matrix scale N. Nevertheless, the\ncomputational capacity of the proposed structure grows propor-\ntionally to N2, thereby emphasizing its advantages in large-scale\narrays.

Introduction\nDue to the huge demand brought by the promotion of autonomous driving and robotics, light detection and ranging \n(LiDAR) technology has attracted extensive attention in the past decade. To date, various types of on-chip beam \nscanners have been demonstrated to replace mechanical scanners [1\u20134]. Optical phased arrays on silicon-on-\ninsulator (SOI) provide an attractive method to perform non-mechanical beam steering [5\u20137]. However, it still \nsuffers from the extensive and complex active phase shifting, in order to calibrate the stochastic phase errors in the \narrayed waveguides [8]. Focal plane switching arrays based on silicon photonics platform and MEMS platform \nemerge as an alternative approach due to the advantages of compact size, low power consumption and simple \ncontrol [9,10]. Among them, beam scanners based on Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer (MZI) abandon the \nmechanical moving parts entirely. In addition, ultra high-speed and low-loss optical switches can be obtained by \nintegrating novel materials with high Pockels coefficients [11,12]. In this work, we demonstrate a hybrid solid-\nstate beam scanner based on a Si3N4 switching array and a blazed grating. The output beam is steered across the \n14.3\u00b0 \u00d7 9.9\u00b0 field of view (FOV) with beam divergence less than 0.1\u00b0. In addition, a ranging distance of 7.4 m is \nachieved by combining the proposed beam scanner and the frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) \ntechnology. \nFig. 1.

Device Fabrication and Beam Steering \nAn optical micrograph of the 32-channel Si3N4 switching array with an overall footprint of 2.2 mm \u00d7 10 mm is \nshown in Fig. 1 (a). The device is fabricated on an 8-inch wafer with a 400 nm-thick PECVD Si3N4 layer by \nAdvanced Micro Foundry. Light is coupled into the chip from a grating coupler. Next, a five-layer binary tree \nformed by cascaded Si3N4 MZI switches routes the incident beam to 32 channels. Thermo-optics phase shifters are \nused to control the on-chip light path. The edge emitters are etched facet inverse tapers with a tip width of 300 nm. \nThe pitch between two adjacent edge emitters is 65 \u00b5m. The schematic of the solid-state beam scanner is depicted in \nFig. 1 (b). Beam emitted from the chip is collimated by an aspherical lens (f = 8.0 mm, NA = 0.5). Then the output \nbeam is aligned to a lithographically patterned diffraction transmission grating (966.18 lines/mm) at the Littrow \nangle. Next, a 45\u00b0 aluminum-coated mirror fixed in the 3D printed mount is used to deflect the beam direction. To \ncharacterize the beam steering, we set a screen in front of the beam scanner at a distance of 2.1 m. An infrared \ncamera records the beam profile on the screen. As shown in Fig. 1 (c), the main beam is steered across a range of \n14.3\u00b0 in \u03b8-direction by toggling the optical switches. Though phase errors still exist in the Si3N4 photonic integrated \ncircuit, the initial phase calibration takes only a few minutes. This problem can be further solved by the real-time \nfeedback control with on-chip power monitors. The angular step between two adjacent points is 0.46\u00b0, which can be \nmuch decreased by enlarging the array size in our future work. A beam steering range of 9.9\u00b0 in the \uf06a-direction is \nachieved by tuning the wavelength from 1500 nm to 1610 nm, as shown in Fig. 1 (d). The steering efficiency thus is \naround 0.09\u00b0/ nm, which is higher than the on-chip Si3N4 grating antenna in [13]. The demand of wideband tunable \nlaser with narrow linewidth still hinders further cost reduction. However, it can be solved by using the massive \ncoherent laser based on the microcomb in [14]. Finally, two-dimensional beam steering is achieved by wavelength \ntuning and switching of channels, as shown in Fig 1. (e). The beam divergency in both directions is measured to be \n< 0.1\u00b0. \n \n3.  FMCW Ranging Operation \nThe setup for FMCW ranging operation is shown in Fig. 2 (a). The FMCW RF signal is provided by the frequency \nsynthesizer based on a fractional-N phased-locked loop (PLL). It generates sawtooth chirps with a period of 1 ms. \nThe chirp range is approximately from 6 GHz to 9 GHz, as shown in Fig. 2 (b). Then the chirped laser light is \nM3F.1\nOFC 2023 \u00a9 Optica Publishing Group 2023\ngenerated by using an optical single sideband modulator. A 3dB optical power splitter distributes the output of the \nmodulator into two components: one goes straight to the balance detector as the local reference light, and the \nremaining is amplified by an Erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) as the input of the Si3N4 chip. The backscattered \nlight from the target is collected by a fiber collimator and routed to the balanced detector. An oscillograph records \nthe output of the balanced photodetector and performs real-time FFT analysis. Representative beat signals in the \ntime domain and the frequency domain of a target at 7.4m away are depicted in Fig. 2 (c) and Fig. 2 (d), respectively. \nFigure 2 (e) shows the measured beat frequency when the target distance varies from 0.7 m to 7.4 m. A strong linear \ncorrelation between the beat frequency and the target distance is observed. The slope of the linear fit is around 20.54 \nkHz/m, which is in line with the chirp slope of \u223c 3 MHz/\u00b5s. It is worth noting that the intercept at the frequency \naxis comes from the fixed fiber length difference. The chirp slope can be further increased by using FMCW PLL ICs \n[15], in order to speed up the ranging operation. \n \n4.  Conclusion \nIn conclusion, we demonstrate a hybrid solid-state beam scanner based on the Si3N4 switching array. The \ncombination of the edge emitter and the external transmission grating improves the beam quality as well as the \noptical emission efficiency. Besides, no prism lens with special designs and mechanical moving components exist in \nthe easily implemented beam scanner. Two-dimensional beam steering with a FOV of 14.3\u00b0 \u00d7 9.9\u00b0 is achieved by \nswitch toggling and wavelength tuning. Furthermore, FMCW ranging operation up to 7.4 m is also presented by \nusing the Si3N4 switching array as the transmitter. Our measurements indicate that the proposed hybrid solid-state \nbeam scanner is a scalable and flexible solution for the next-generation FMCW LiDAR. \n \n5.  References \n \n[1] D. N. Hutchison, J.

Introduction\nDue to the huge demand brought by the promotion of autonomous driving and robotics, light detection and ranging \n(LiDAR) technology has attracted extensive attention in the past decade. To date, various types of on-chip beam \nscanners have been demonstrated to replace mechanical scanners [1\u20134]. Optical phased arrays on silicon-on-\ninsulator (SOI) provide an attractive method to perform non-mechanical beam steering [5\u20137]. However, it still \nsuffers from the extensive and complex active phase shifting, in order to calibrate the stochastic phase errors in the \narrayed waveguides [8]. Focal plane switching arrays based on silicon photonics platform and MEMS platform \nemerge as an alternative approach due to the advantages of compact size, low power consumption and simple \ncontrol [9,10]. Among them, beam scanners based on Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer (MZI) abandon the \nmechanical moving parts entirely. In addition, ultra high-speed and low-loss optical switches can be obtained by \nintegrating novel materials with high Pockels coefficients [11,12]. In this work, we demonstrate a hybrid solid-\nstate beam scanner based on a Si3N4 switching array and a blazed grating. The output beam is steered across the \n14.3\u00b0 \u00d7 9.9\u00b0 field of view (FOV) with beam divergence less than 0.1\u00b0. In addition, a ranging distance of 7.4 m is \nachieved by combining the proposed beam scanner and the frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) \ntechnology. \nFig. 1.

Device Fabrication and Beam Steering \nAn optical micrograph of the 32-channel Si3N4 switching array with an overall footprint of 2.2 mm \u00d7 10 mm is \nshown in Fig. 1 (a). The device is fabricated on an 8-inch wafer with a 400 nm-thick PECVD Si3N4 layer by \nAdvanced Micro Foundry. Light is coupled into the chip from a grating coupler. Next, a five-layer binary tree \nformed by cascaded Si3N4 MZI switches routes the incident beam to 32 channels. Thermo-optics phase shifters are \nused to control the on-chip light path. The edge emitters are etched facet inverse tapers with a tip width of 300 nm. \nThe pitch between two adjacent edge emitters is 65 \u00b5m. The schematic of the solid-state beam scanner is depicted in \nFig. 1 (b). Beam emitted from the chip is collimated by an aspherical lens (f = 8.0 mm, NA = 0.5). Then the output \nbeam is aligned to a lithographically patterned diffraction transmission grating (966.18 lines/mm) at the Littrow \nangle. Next, a 45\u00b0 aluminum-coated mirror fixed in the 3D printed mount is used to deflect the beam direction. To \ncharacterize the beam steering, we set a screen in front of the beam scanner at a distance of 2.1 m. An infrared \ncamera records the beam profile on the screen. As shown in Fig. 1 (c), the main beam is steered across a range of \n14.3\u00b0 in \u03b8-direction by toggling the optical switches. Though phase errors still exist in the Si3N4 photonic integrated \ncircuit, the initial phase calibration takes only a few minutes. This problem can be further solved by the real-time \nfeedback control with on-chip power monitors. The angular step between two adjacent points is 0.46\u00b0, which can be \nmuch decreased by enlarging the array size in our future work. A beam steering range of 9.9\u00b0 in the \uf06a-direction is \nachieved by tuning the wavelength from 1500 nm to 1610 nm, as shown in Fig. 1 (d). The steering efficiency thus is \naround 0.09\u00b0/ nm, which is higher than the on-chip Si3N4 grating antenna in [13]. The demand of wideband tunable \nlaser with narrow linewidth still hinders further cost reduction. However, it can be solved by using the massive \ncoherent laser based on the microcomb in [14]. Finally, two-dimensional beam steering is achieved by wavelength \ntuning and switching of channels, as shown in Fig 1. (e). The beam divergency in both directions is measured to be \n< 0.1\u00b0. \n \n3.  FMCW Ranging Operation \nThe setup for FMCW ranging operation is shown in Fig. 2 (a). The FMCW RF signal is provided by the frequency \nsynthesizer based on a fractional-N phased-locked loop (PLL). It generates sawtooth chirps with a period of 1 ms. \nThe chirp range is approximately from 6 GHz to 9 GHz, as shown in Fig. 2 (b). Then the chirped laser light is \nM3F.1\nOFC 2023 \u00a9 Optica Publishing Group 2023\ngenerated by using an optical single sideband modulator. A 3dB optical power splitter distributes the output of the \nmodulator into two components: one goes straight to the balance detector as the local reference light, and the \nremaining is amplified by an Erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) as the input of the Si3N4 chip. The backscattered \nlight from the target is collected by a fiber collimator and routed to the balanced detector. An oscillograph records \nthe output of the balanced photodetector and performs real-time FFT analysis. Representative beat signals in the \ntime domain and the frequency domain of a target at 7.4m away are depicted in Fig. 2 (c) and Fig. 2 (d), respectively. \nFigure 2 (e) shows the measured beat frequency when the target distance varies from 0.7 m to 7.4 m. A strong linear \ncorrelation between the beat frequency and the target distance is observed. The slope of the linear fit is around 20.54 \nkHz/m, which is in line with the chirp slope of \u223c 3 MHz/\u00b5s. It is worth noting that the intercept at the frequency \naxis comes from the fixed fiber length difference. The chirp slope can be further increased by using FMCW PLL ICs \n[15], in order to speed up the ranging operation. \n \n4.  Conclusion \nIn conclusion, we demonstrate a hybrid solid-state beam scanner based on the Si3N4 switching array. The \ncombination of the edge emitter and the external transmission grating improves the beam quality as well as the \noptical emission efficiency. Besides, no prism lens with special designs and mechanical moving components exist in \nthe easily implemented beam scanner. Two-dimensional beam steering with a FOV of 14.3\u00b0 \u00d7 9.9\u00b0 is achieved by \nswitch toggling and wavelength tuning. Furthermore, FMCW ranging operation up to 7.4 m is also presented by \nusing the Si3N4 switching array as the transmitter. Our measurements indicate that the proposed hybrid solid-state \nbeam scanner is a scalable and flexible solution for the next-generation FMCW LiDAR. \n \n5.  References \n \n[1] D. N. Hutchison, J.

Introduction\nDue to the huge demand brought by the promotion of autonomous driving and robotics, light detection and ranging \n(LiDAR) technology has attracted extensive attention in the past decade. To date, various types of on-chip beam \nscanners have been demonstrated to replace mechanical scanners [1\u20134]. Optical phased arrays on silicon-on-\ninsulator (SOI) provide an attractive method to perform non-mechanical beam steering [5\u20137]. However, it still \nsuffers from the extensive and complex active phase shifting, in order to calibrate the stochastic phase errors in the \narrayed waveguides [8]. Focal plane switching arrays based on silicon photonics platform and MEMS platform \nemerge as an alternative approach due to the advantages of compact size, low power consumption and simple \ncontrol [9,10]. Among them, beam scanners based on Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer (MZI) abandon the \nmechanical moving parts entirely. In addition, ultra high-speed and low-loss optical switches can be obtained by \nintegrating novel materials with high Pockels coefficients [11,12]. In this work, we demonstrate a hybrid solid-\nstate beam scanner based on a Si3N4 switching array and a blazed grating. The output beam is steered across the \n14.3\u00b0 \u00d7 9.9\u00b0 field of view (FOV) with beam divergence less than 0.1\u00b0. In addition, a ranging distance of 7.4 m is \nachieved by combining the proposed beam scanner and the frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) \ntechnology. \nFig. 1.

Device Fabrication and Beam Steering \nAn optical micrograph of the 32-channel Si3N4 switching array with an overall footprint of 2.2 mm \u00d7 10 mm is \nshown in Fig. 1 (a). The device is fabricated on an 8-inch wafer with a 400 nm-thick PECVD Si3N4 layer by \nAdvanced Micro Foundry. Light is coupled into the chip from a grating coupler. Next, a five-layer binary tree \nformed by cascaded Si3N4 MZI switches routes the incident beam to 32 channels. Thermo-optics phase shifters are \nused to control the on-chip light path. The edge emitters are etched facet inverse tapers with a tip width of 300 nm. \nThe pitch between two adjacent edge emitters is 65 \u00b5m. The schematic of the solid-state beam scanner is depicted in \nFig. 1 (b). Beam emitted from the chip is collimated by an aspherical lens (f = 8.0 mm, NA = 0.5). Then the output \nbeam is aligned to a lithographically patterned diffraction transmission grating (966.18 lines/mm) at the Littrow \nangle. Next, a 45\u00b0 aluminum-coated mirror fixed in the 3D printed mount is used to deflect the beam direction. To \ncharacterize the beam steering, we set a screen in front of the beam scanner at a distance of 2.1 m. An infrared \ncamera records the beam profile on the screen. As shown in Fig. 1 (c), the main beam is steered across a range of \n14.3\u00b0 in \u03b8-direction by toggling the optical switches. Though phase errors still exist in the Si3N4 photonic integrated \ncircuit, the initial phase calibration takes only a few minutes. This problem can be further solved by the real-time \nfeedback control with on-chip power monitors. The angular step between two adjacent points is 0.46\u00b0, which can be \nmuch decreased by enlarging the array size in our future work. A beam steering range of 9.9\u00b0 in the \uf06a-direction is \nachieved by tuning the wavelength from 1500 nm to 1610 nm, as shown in Fig. 1 (d). The steering efficiency thus is \naround 0.09\u00b0/ nm, which is higher than the on-chip Si3N4 grating antenna in [13]. The demand of wideband tunable \nlaser with narrow linewidth still hinders further cost reduction. However, it can be solved by using the massive \ncoherent laser based on the microcomb in [14]. Finally, two-dimensional beam steering is achieved by wavelength \ntuning and switching of channels, as shown in Fig 1. (e). The beam divergency in both directions is measured to be \n< 0.1\u00b0. \n \n3.  FMCW Ranging Operation \nThe setup for FMCW ranging operation is shown in Fig. 2 (a). The FMCW RF signal is provided by the frequency \nsynthesizer based on a fractional-N phased-locked loop (PLL). It generates sawtooth chirps with a period of 1 ms. \nThe chirp range is approximately from 6 GHz to 9 GHz, as shown in Fig. 2 (b). Then the chirped laser light is \nM3F.1\nOFC 2023 \u00a9 Optica Publishing Group 2023\ngenerated by using an optical single sideband modulator. A 3dB optical power splitter distributes the output of the \nmodulator into two components: one goes straight to the balance detector as the local reference light, and the \nremaining is amplified by an Erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) as the input of the Si3N4 chip. The backscattered \nlight from the target is collected by a fiber collimator and routed to the balanced detector. An oscillograph records \nthe output of the balanced photodetector and performs real-time FFT analysis. Representative beat signals in the \ntime domain and the frequency domain of a target at 7.4m away are depicted in Fig. 2 (c) and Fig. 2 (d), respectively. \nFigure 2 (e) shows the measured beat frequency when the target distance varies from 0.7 m to 7.4 m. A strong linear \ncorrelation between the beat frequency and the target distance is observed. The slope of the linear fit is around 20.54 \nkHz/m, which is in line with the chirp slope of \u223c 3 MHz/\u00b5s. It is worth noting that the intercept at the frequency \naxis comes from the fixed fiber length difference. The chirp slope can be further increased by using FMCW PLL ICs \n[15], in order to speed up the ranging operation. \n \n4.  Conclusion \nIn conclusion, we demonstrate a hybrid solid-state beam scanner based on the Si3N4 switching array. The \ncombination of the edge emitter and the external transmission grating improves the beam quality as well as the \noptical emission efficiency. Besides, no prism lens with special designs and mechanical moving components exist in \nthe easily implemented beam scanner. Two-dimensional beam steering with a FOV of 14.3\u00b0 \u00d7 9.9\u00b0 is achieved by \nswitch toggling and wavelength tuning. Furthermore, FMCW ranging operation up to 7.4 m is also presented by \nusing the Si3N4 switching array as the transmitter. Our measurements indicate that the proposed hybrid solid-state \nbeam scanner is a scalable and flexible solution for the next-generation FMCW LiDAR. \n \n5.  References \n \n[1] D. N. Hutchison, J.

Introduction\nDue to the huge demand brought by the promotion of autonomous driving and robotics, light detection and ranging \n(LiDAR) technology has attracted extensive attention in the past decade. To date, various types of on-chip beam \nscanners have been demonstrated to replace mechanical scanners [1\u20134]. Optical phased arrays on silicon-on-\ninsulator (SOI) provide an attractive method to perform non-mechanical beam steering [5\u20137]. However, it still \nsuffers from the extensive and complex active phase shifting, in order to calibrate the stochastic phase errors in the \narrayed waveguides [8]. Focal plane switching arrays based on silicon photonics platform and MEMS platform \nemerge as an alternative approach due to the advantages of compact size, low power consumption and simple \ncontrol [9,10]. Among them, beam scanners based on Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer (MZI) abandon the \nmechanical moving parts entirely. In addition, ultra high-speed and low-loss optical switches can be obtained by \nintegrating novel materials with high Pockels coefficients [11,12]. In this work, we demonstrate a hybrid solid-\nstate beam scanner based on a Si3N4 switching array and a blazed grating. The output beam is steered across the \n14.3\u00b0 \u00d7 9.9\u00b0 field of view (FOV) with beam divergence less than 0.1\u00b0. In addition, a ranging distance of 7.4 m is \nachieved by combining the proposed beam scanner and the frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) \ntechnology. \nFig. 1.

Device Fabrication and Beam Steering \nAn optical micrograph of the 32-channel Si3N4 switching array with an overall footprint of 2.2 mm \u00d7 10 mm is \nshown in Fig. 1 (a). The device is fabricated on an 8-inch wafer with a 400 nm-thick PECVD Si3N4 layer by \nAdvanced Micro Foundry. Light is coupled into the chip from a grating coupler. Next, a five-layer binary tree \nformed by cascaded Si3N4 MZI switches routes the incident beam to 32 channels. Thermo-optics phase shifters are \nused to control the on-chip light path. The edge emitters are etched facet inverse tapers with a tip width of 300 nm. \nThe pitch between two adjacent edge emitters is 65 \u00b5m. The schematic of the solid-state beam scanner is depicted in \nFig. 1 (b). Beam emitted from the chip is collimated by an aspherical lens (f = 8.0 mm, NA = 0.5). Then the output \nbeam is aligned to a lithographically patterned diffraction transmission grating (966.18 lines/mm) at the Littrow \nangle. Next, a 45\u00b0 aluminum-coated mirror fixed in the 3D printed mount is used to deflect the beam direction. To \ncharacterize the beam steering, we set a screen in front of the beam scanner at a distance of 2.1 m. An infrared \ncamera records the beam profile on the screen. As shown in Fig. 1 (c), the main beam is steered across a range of \n14.3\u00b0 in \u03b8-direction by toggling the optical switches. Though phase errors still exist in the Si3N4 photonic integrated \ncircuit, the initial phase calibration takes only a few minutes. This problem can be further solved by the real-time \nfeedback control with on-chip power monitors. The angular step between two adjacent points is 0.46\u00b0, which can be \nmuch decreased by enlarging the array size in our future work. A beam steering range of 9.9\u00b0 in the \uf06a-direction is \nachieved by tuning the wavelength from 1500 nm to 1610 nm, as shown in Fig. 1 (d). The steering efficiency thus is \naround 0.09\u00b0/ nm, which is higher than the on-chip Si3N4 grating antenna in [13]. The demand of wideband tunable \nlaser with narrow linewidth still hinders further cost reduction. However, it can be solved by using the massive \ncoherent laser based on the microcomb in [14]. Finally, two-dimensional beam steering is achieved by wavelength \ntuning and switching of channels, as shown in Fig 1. (e). The beam divergency in both directions is measured to be \n< 0.1\u00b0. \n \n3.  FMCW Ranging Operation \nThe setup for FMCW ranging operation is shown in Fig. 2 (a). The FMCW RF signal is provided by the frequency \nsynthesizer based on a fractional-N phased-locked loop (PLL). It generates sawtooth chirps with a period of 1 ms. \nThe chirp range is approximately from 6 GHz to 9 GHz, as shown in Fig. 2 (b). Then the chirped laser light is \nM3F.1\nOFC 2023 \u00a9 Optica Publishing Group 2023\ngenerated by using an optical single sideband modulator. A 3dB optical power splitter distributes the output of the \nmodulator into two components: one goes straight to the balance detector as the local reference light, and the \nremaining is amplified by an Erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) as the input of the Si3N4 chip. The backscattered \nlight from the target is collected by a fiber collimator and routed to the balanced detector. An oscillograph records \nthe output of the balanced photodetector and performs real-time FFT analysis. Representative beat signals in the \ntime domain and the frequency domain of a target at 7.4m away are depicted in Fig. 2 (c) and Fig. 2 (d), respectively. \nFigure 2 (e) shows the measured beat frequency when the target distance varies from 0.7 m to 7.4 m. A strong linear \ncorrelation between the beat frequency and the target distance is observed. The slope of the linear fit is around 20.54 \nkHz/m, which is in line with the chirp slope of \u223c 3 MHz/\u00b5s. It is worth noting that the intercept at the frequency \naxis comes from the fixed fiber length difference. The chirp slope can be further increased by using FMCW PLL ICs \n[15], in order to speed up the ranging operation. \n \n4.  Conclusion \nIn conclusion, we demonstrate a hybrid solid-state beam scanner based on the Si3N4 switching array. The \ncombination of the edge emitter and the external transmission grating improves the beam quality as well as the \noptical emission efficiency. Besides, no prism lens with special designs and mechanical moving components exist in \nthe easily implemented beam scanner. Two-dimensional beam steering with a FOV of 14.3\u00b0 \u00d7 9.9\u00b0 is achieved by \nswitch toggling and wavelength tuning. Furthermore, FMCW ranging operation up to 7.4 m is also presented by \nusing the Si3N4 switching array as the transmitter. Our measurements indicate that the proposed hybrid solid-state \nbeam scanner is a scalable and flexible solution for the next-generation FMCW LiDAR. \n \n5.  References \n \n[1] D. N. Hutchison, J.
