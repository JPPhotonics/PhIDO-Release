  description: The task describes the design of a three-stage 1x8 power splitter using
    Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZIs) arranged in a tree structure. The first stage
    includes 1 MZI with a 50/50 splitting ratio, the second stage includes 2 MZIs,
    and the third stage includes 4 MZIs. All MZIs have 500nm wide waveguides suitable
    for C-band operation.

  title: Design of a 1x8 Power Splitter using MZI Tree Structure
edges: The power splitter is designed using a three-stage MZI tree structure. The
  first stage consists of 1 MZI that splits into 2 outputs. The second stage uses
  2 MZIs, each splitting their inputs into 4 outputs in total. The third stage comprises
  4 MZIs, further splitting the 4 inputs into 8 outputs total.
