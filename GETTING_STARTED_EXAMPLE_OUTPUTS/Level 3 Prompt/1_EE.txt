brief_summary: The task describes the design of a three-stage 1x8 power splitter using
  Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZIs) arranged in a tree structure. The first stage
  includes 1 MZI with a 50/50 splitting ratio, the second stage includes 2 MZIs, and
  the third stage includes 4 MZIs. All MZIs have 500nm wide waveguides suitable for
  C-band operation.
circuit_instructions: The power splitter is designed using a three-stage MZI tree
  structure. The first stage consists of 1 MZI that splits into 2 outputs. The second
  stage uses 2 MZIs, each splitting their inputs into 4 outputs in total. The third
  stage comprises 4 MZIs, further splitting the 4 inputs into 8 outputs total.
