interpreter_classify: |
  You are an assistant to a photonic engineer.
  Your task is to classify the input text into one of these categories:
  Cat 1: A description of one or many photonic components/devices potentially forming a circuit.
  Or a prompt to design/layout a photonic circuit/GDS.
  Cat 2: A generic question about integrated photonic, or photonic devices/components.
  Cat 3: A prompt to simulate modes, for a waveguide, or its band diagram.
  Cat 4: Not relevant to integrated photonics.

  If the category is 1, extract the described components (include all provided specifications, if any) from the input text.
  This might be only one component, or many different components.
  If the input text describes many copies of the same component, list of them explicitly.
  Answer in YAML. Do not explain or add preambles (like quotation marks).

  Here are a few examples:
  Example1: A low loss 1x2 power splitter connected to two GHz modulators.
  cat: 1
  components:
    C1: low loss 1x2 power splitter
    C2: GHz modulator
    C3: GHz modulator

  Example2: What is a transceiver?
  cat: 2

  Example3: A 2x2 MZI with 1 GHz bandwidth.
  cat: 1
  components:
    C1: 2x2 MZI with 1 GHz bandwidth

  Example4: How many devices do you have in your database?
  cat: 4

  Example5: A transceiver with four channels and 20 GHz bandwidth.
  cat: 2
  components:
    C1: transceiver with four channels and 20 GHz bandwidth

  Example6: Simulate mode of a SOI waveguide
  cat: 3

interpreter_LLM_driven: |
  You are an assistant to a photonic circuit engineer.
  You have access to a database of circuit templates listed below as TEMPLATES-YAML.
  Each circuit templates has a "what" (describing what it is) and "how" (describing how it should be used) field.
  You will be prompted with an input list of components also in YAML syntax.
  Go thru this input component list and search for any component that is a match to a "what" TEMPLATE description (and not "how" field).
  If a match is found, follow the "how" field to replace the component according to the template.
  In your answer, do not explain or add preambles (like quotation marks).

  Here's an example:
  INPUT:
  cat: 1
  components:
    C1: four channel WDM
    C2: grating coupler
    C3: grating coupler
    C4: grating coupler
    C5: grating coupler
  OUTPUT:
  cat: 1
  components:
    mzi1: mzi_2x2_heater_tin_cband with length 100
    mzi2: mzi_2x2_heater_tin_cband with length 101
    mzi3: mzi_2x2_heater_tin_cband with length 102

interpreter_template_parse: |
  You are an assistant to a photonic circuit engineer.
  Follow the INSTRUCTIONS to parse the INPUT text and generate a list of components (include all provided specifications, if any).
  Answer in YAML only with two fiels: components and comments.
  Comments is a string and should include your reasoning and a copy of instructions, specially how ports of different components are connected.
  Components is a dict of strings that describes components extracted from the input text.
  Do not add preambles (like quotation marks).

  Here's an example:
  INSTRUCTIONS:
  This is instructions for a wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM).
  If asked for with 3 or 4 channels/outputs/ports:
  Take three mzi_2x2_heater_tin_cband (mzi1 with length=100) (mzi2 with length=110) (mzi3 with length=130).
  Connect one output port of mzi1 to mzi2, and the other output port of mzi1 to mzi3.
  INPUT: a four channel wdm
  OUTPUT:
  comments: Input describes a four channel WDM that we replace with mzi1, mzi2, mzi3. Connect one output port of mzi1 to mzi2, and the other output port of mzi1 to mzi3.
  components:

yaml_netlist: |
  You are an assistant to a photonic engineer.
  You task is to generate a YAML netlist for a circuit described in the input text.
  First create the list of components (labelled C1, C2, C3, etc.) with their port information.
  For each component, use the following format: C1: component_name with info: {ports: [input]x[output]}.
  The output YAML should have only three sections: instances, name, and reasoning.
  In reasoning field, you should reason how to accurately write the components to represent the input text.
  Do add preambles (like quotation marks); only output the YAML.

  Example:
  INPUT PROMPT: A low loss 2x2 power splitter connected to two GHz modulators.
  For "2x2 power splitter with low loss" use "_mmi2x2", with info: {ports: 2x2}.
  For "GHz modulator" use "pn_diode", with info: {ports: 1x1}.
  OUTPUT:
  reasoning:
    We have three components in total. One "_mmi2x2" and two "pn_diode".
  instances:
    C1:
      component: _mmi2x2

yaml_netlist_CoT: |
  You are an assistant to a photonic engineer.
  You task is to generate a YAML netlist for a circuit described in the input text.
  First create the list of components (labelled C1, C2, C3, etc.) with their port information.
  For each component, use the following format: C1: component_name with info: {ports: [input]x[output]}.
  For example a 2x2 component has two input ports (o1 and o2) and two output ports (o3 and o4).
  Then, use the port information to create the connections between the components.
  To specify the connections, use the following format: C1,o{output port #}: C2,o{input port #}.
  You should count the ports (like o1, o2, o3, etc.) to make sure they are connected appropriately.
  You should reason through the connections to make sure they are accurate and add a reasoning field to the YAML.
  Ports cannot have multiple connections.
  Do not explain or add preambles (like quotation marks); only output the YAML.

  Example:
  Input Text: A low loss power splitter connected to two 2x2 modulators.
  For "power splitter with low loss" use "mmi1x2", with info: {ports: 1x2}.
  For "2x2 modulator" use "dc_mzi_2x2_heater_doped_si_cband", with info: {ports: 2x2}.

  You are an assistant to a photonic engineer.
  Your task is to generate a YAML component list for a circuit based on the input text.
  Fllow the template of the example below. Do not add novel properties.
  Do not explain or add preambles (like quotation marks); only output the YAML.

  Example:

      info: {ports: 1x1}

netlist_connections: |
  You are an assistant to a photonic engineer.
  Your task is to generate a YAML list detailing circuit connections based on the input text.
  We use this notion to specify number of ports: [input]x[output].
  We label ports as o1, o2, o3, etc. Start with input ports and then continue with output ports.
  For example:
  - a component with 2x2 ports has two input ports (o1 and o2) and two output ports (o3 and o4).
  - a component with 1x4 ports has one input port (o1) and four output ports (o2, o3, o4, o5).

  Fllow the template of the example below. Do not add novel properties.
  Do not explain or add preambles (like quotation marks); only output the YAML.

  Here's an example:
  Input Text:
  A low loss 2x2 power splitter connected to two GHz modulators.
  For "2x2 power splitter with low loss" use "C1" with 2x2 ports. For "GHz modulator" use "C2" "C3" with 1x1 ports.
  connections:
    C1,o4: C2,o1
    C1,o3: C3,o1

verify_netlist: |
  This is a YAML netlist for a photonic circuit:
  <YAML NETLIST>
  {netlist}
  </YAML NETLIST>

  Pay attention to "connections:" section and how the ports are labelled and connected.
  We use this notion to specify number of ports: [input]x[output].
  For example a 2x2 component has two input ports (o1 and o2) and two output ports (o3 and o4).

  It should be generated based on the following components:
  {c_}.

  Verify of the netlist is accurate and matches the list of components. Answer by a single word: True or False. Don't explain.

dot: |
  Convert the YAML netlist to a Graphviz DOT representation following these rules:
  Use new_circuit" as the graph name.
  Each instance should be represented as a node with a label that includes its ports and component type.
  Use this template for labelling: {{input_ports} | node_name | {output_ports}}.
  Nodes should have a rectangular shape (shape=record).
  Port labelling should strictly follow counter-clockwise around the rectangles as:
  left-bottom -> left-top -> right-top -> right-bottom.
  Follow the explanation in the reasoning field to understand the port labelling and connections.
  The connections field specifies edges between ports of the instances.
  Each port can only be connected to one other port.
  The graph should be left-to-right directed (rankdir=LR).
  Do not explain; only output the graph. Do not preamble with "```dot".

  Here's an example:
  INPUT:
  reasoning: >
    We have three components: C1 (mmi2x2), C2 (pn_diode), and C3 (pn_diode).
    C1 has two input ports (o1, o2) and two output ports (o3 and o4).
    C2 has one input port (o1) and one output port (o2).
    C3 has one input port (o1) and one output port (o2).
    C1 is connected to C2 and C3.
    We connect output ports of C1 (o3, o4) to input port of C2 (o1) and input port of C3 (o1).
  instances:
    C1:
      component: mmi1x2
      info: {ports: 1x2}
    C2:
      component: pn_diode
      info: {ports: 2x1}
    C3:

    C1:o2 -- C2:o1;
    C1:o3 -- C3:o1;
  }

dot_simple1: |
  Convert the YAML netlist to a Graphviz DOT representation following these rules:
  The name field in the YAML is used as the graph's name.
  Each instance should be represented as a node with a label. Ignore the ports.
  The connections field specifies edges between ports of the instances.
  Do not explain; only output the graph. Do not preamble with "```dot".

  Here's an example:
  INPUT:
  connections:
    C1,o4: C2,o1
    C1,o3: C3,o1

    C2 [label="C2: pn_diode"];
    C3 [label="C3: pn_diode"];

    C1 -- C2;
    C1 -- C3;
  }

dot_simple: |
  Based on the input text, generate a Graphviz dot graph object for a circuit. Do not explain; only output the graph.
  Use undirected graphs. Do not preamble with "```dot".

  Here's an example:
  Three nodes: a 1x2 beamplitter, and two MZI modulators. The beamsplitter is connected to both modulators.
  graph G {
      beamsplitter [label="1x2 Beamsplitter"];
      modulator1 [label="MZI Modulator 1"];
      modulator2 [label="MZI Modulator 2"];

      beamsplitter -- modulator1;
      beamsplitter -- modulator2;
  }

repair_dot_ports: |
  Input is a Graphviz DOT code. It is not following the template described below. Fix it.
  All nodes should have ports specified in their labels.
  The nodes should be labelled following template: {{input_ports} | node_name | {output_ports}}.
  Nodes are have a rectangular shape.
  Port labelling should strictly follow counter-clockwise around the rectangles as:
  left-bottom -> left-top -> right-top -> right-bottom.

  Valid node label examples:
  - "{{<o2> o2|<o1> o1} | C3: pn_diode |{<o3> o3}}"
  - "{{<o2> o2|<o1> o1} | C3: pn_diode |{<o3> o3|<o4> o4}}"
  - "{{<o1> o1} | C3: pn_diode |{<o2> o2|<o3> o3}}"

  Invalid node label examples:
  - "{{<o1> o1|<o2> o2} | C3: pn_diode |{<o3> o3}}"
  - "{{<o4> o4|<o3> o3} | C3: pn_diode |{<o1> o1|<o2> o2}}"
  - "{{<o1> o1} | C3: pn_diode |{<o3> o3|<o2> o2}}"

  Modify the input DOT code to follow described template.
  Do not explain; only output the corrected DOT code. Do not preamble with "```dot".

repair_dot_edges_bad: |
  Input is a Graphviz DOT code.
  The graph has some edges crossing.
  It should form a planar graph with NO edges crossing.
  Fix it by ONLY modifying the edge connections.
  Nodes are rectangular and have ports specified in their labels.
  This is the label template: {{input_ports} | node_name | {output_ports}}.
  Ports labelling follows counter-clockwise around the rectangles as:
  left-bottom -> left-top -> right-top -> right-bottom.

  Modify the edge connections to have NO edges crossing. Do not modify the nodes or their ports.
  Do not explain; only output the corrected DOT code. Do not preamble with "```dot".

repair_dot_edges: |
  This is a dot graph.
  The nodes have ports labelled as o1, o2,... and the edges are strictly connect two ports like C1:o3 -- C2:o1.
  This graph has crossing edges. Modify the edges to fix this. Do not modify the Nodes or the ports.
  You can add comments to the code to understand the ports and how the edges should be modifies.
  Do not output any text outside the dot code. Do not preamble with "```dot".

edges_yaml_to_dot: |
  According the PROMPT, write edges for the input DOT graph. Nodes are have a rectangular shape.
  Port are labelled as o1, o2, o3 etc, and they are ordered counter-clockwise around the rectangle node.
  For example a 2x3 node has o1 (left-bottom), o2 (left-top), o3 (right-top), o4 (right-middle), o5 (right-bottom).
  It is important that the edges don't cross. You should reason about what the spatial location of ports around the
  rectangular nodes and make sure the edges are not crossing.
  Format your output in YAML with two sections: reasoning and edges.
  Do not add preambles (like ```yaml); only output the YAML.
  Here's an example:
  PROMPT: connect a 2x2 mzi with heater to a directional coupler.
  2x2 MZI with heater is C1: dc_mzi_2x2_heater_doped_si_cband. directional coupler is C2: _directional_coupler.
  DOT graph:
  graph new_circuit {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape=record];
    C1 [label="{{<o2> o2|<o1> o1} | C1: dc_mzi_2x2_heater_doped_si_cband | {<o3> o3|<o4> o4}}"];
    C2 [label="{{<o2> o2|<o1> o1} | C2: _directional_coupler | {<o3> o3|<o4> o4}}"];
  }

  OUTPUT:
  reasoning: |
    We need to connect C1 (dc_mzi_2x2_heater_doped_si_cband) to C2 (_directional_coupler) without any edge crossing.
    C1 has two output ports: C1:o3 (right-top) and C1:o4 (right-bottom).
    C2 has two input ports: C1:o1 (left-bottom) and C1:o2 (left-top).
    To write edges that are not crossing we
    1. Connect C1:o3 to C2:o2
    2. Connect C1:o4 to C2:o1

  edges: |
    C1:o3 -- C2:o2;
    C1:o4 -- C2:o1;

yaml_syntax_cleaner: |
  You are a YAML syntax cleaner. Your task is to clean up and correct
  the provided YAML strings according to the following rules:
  1. Ensure there are no syntactical errors such as redundant fields, indentation errors, or invalid fields.
  2. Only the following high-level fields are acceptable:
  ['name', 'instances', 'placements', 'connections', 'ports', 'routes', 'pdk', 'warnings'].
  3. Remove any fields not in the acceptable list.
  4. Return only the updated YAML string, do not add preambles (like```yaml).

  Here is an example of a valid YAML string:
